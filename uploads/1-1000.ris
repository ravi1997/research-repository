AB  - IntroductionDiffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas are associated with dismal survival outcomes. Conventional fractionation radiation to a dose of 60 Gy is the standard of treatment. This retrospective review aims to compare survival and toxicity outcomes of patients treated with conventional fractionation (CF) and hypofractionation (HF) radiotherapy.Materials and methodsTreatment-na & iuml;ve diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma patients undergoing radical radiation were analyzed. CF was delivered to a dose of 50-60 Gy in 25-30 fractions, while HF was delivered as 38-40 Gy in 12-15 fractions. All patients were planned via the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique.ResultsA total of 64 patients were eligible for analysis. The median age of presentation was 10 years. Motor deficit was the most common presenting complaint in 51.6% of the patients, with a median symptom duration of 2 months. The pons was the most frequent site of disease epicenter in 71.8% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 9.45 months (range 0.23-72.63 months), 23 patients died, and 28 patients experienced disease progression. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death in patients treated with HF as compared to CF was 1.330 (95% CI 0.522-3.386) (p-value 0.550, by Cox regression analysis). The median OS for the entire cohort was 13.9 months, while it was 9.7 months (95% CI 5.65-13.74) and 15.1 months (95% CI 9.02-21.18) (p-value = 0.547) with CF and HF, respectively. On multivariate analysis, disease epicenter in the pons was the only significant factor associated with PFS. Hypofractionation was associated with a significantly higher aspiration rate and Ryle's tube requirement (p-value 0.027).ConclusionHypofractionated radiation can be considered for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma with optimum supportive care.

AB  - Cerebral hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is uncommon in children but presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its potential to mimic malignancy. Only a handful of cases with such a dilemma have been reported yet in the literature. We report a case of a 12-year-old female presenting with progressive headache and seizures, initially suspected to be a pilocytic astrocytoma. However, histopathological evaluation following surgical excision of the lesion rendered an unexpected diagnosis of a cerebral hydatid cyst. This emphasizes the importance of considering parasitic infections in the differential diagnosis of cystic brain lesions, particularly in endemic regions. Surgical removal without rupture is critical to prevent recurrence and complications. This case highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the clinical, imaging, and histopathological assessments to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely appropriate intervention to improve outcomes of such rare intracranial pathologies mimicking malignancy in children.

AB  - Background and objectives Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a malignant round-cell tumor arising from the bone and soft tissue. It is a disease of children and young adults. EWS affecting the central nervous system (cranial and spinal column) is relatively rare with an annual incidence of approximately one case per million in the Western population. Due to their rarity, very few studies are available in the literature. We present our experience of managing 21 such cases, highlighting their clinical, and radiological findings, treatment strategy, and surgical outcomes in patients with primary EWS affecting the central nervous system. Materials and methods We retrospectively collected hospital records of patients with primary EWS affecting the CNS (cranial and spinal column), who had been surgically treated in our Neuroscience Center between 2015 and 2023. Patients' demographics, presentation, radiological findings, treatment strategy including surgery and biopsy followed by adjuvant therapy, and outcome at discharge, and the latest follow-up were analyzed from our database. Results There were sixteen male and five female patients with a mean age of 18.22 +/- 12.73 years (ranging from 6 months to 59 years). The commonest presentation was headache and vomiting in cranial lesions (5/13 patients, 38.46%), and back pain in spinal lesions (4/8 patients, 50%). The site of lesions was cranial in thirteen patients (61.9%) and spinal column in eight patients (38.1%). The commonest site was the frontal region in the cranial group (6 patients, 46.15%) and the lumbar region in the spinal group (4 patients, 50%). All patients underwent surgical intervention [tumor resection (18) and biopsy (3)]. Tumor resection was achieved in 18 patients (85.71%). The extent of resection was gross-total excision in 9 patients (42.86%), near-total excision in 5 patients (23.8%), and tumor decompression in 4 patients (19%). Four patients underwent spinal instrumentation. Fifteen patients (71.42%) received multiagent chemo-radiotherapy according to institute protocol. Five patients (23.8%) with poor KPS expired within 6 months of surgery and could not receive adjuvant therapy. Two patients (9.52%) improved symptomatically, and nine patients (42.86%) remained asymptomatic at a mean follow-up of 25.1 +/- 29 months. One patient (4.76%) after receiving 2 cycles of adjuvant therapy had initial improvement but expired later due to disease progression. Four patients after adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (19%) expired due to systemic spread. Conclusion Primary EWS affecting the central nervous system is a rare variety. A detailed radiological assessment can aid in adequate planning for safe maximal resection. Timely tissue diagnosis is essential for initiating early treatment. Radical excision followed by adjuvant therapy offers a favorable outcome. Postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy aids in optimal disease control and surgical outcome. With the current treatment strategy, good surgical outcomes can be achieved. However, metastasis is not uncommon and should be evaluated regularly.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of circumferential gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) vs hemi-GATT in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). center dot DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. center dot METHODS: This study included children with PCG having corneal diameters < 14 mm and relatively clear cornea. The eyes included were randomized to undergo either circumferential GATT (360-GATT) or hemiGATT (180-GATT). The intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, requirement for glaucoma medications after surgery, need for repeat surgery, and the incidence and type of complications in each group were analyzed. Surgical success was defined as absolute when IOP <= 18 mm Hg (criterion A) and <= 15 mm Hg (criterion B) was achieved without medications and qualified when the same was achieved with pressure-lowering medications. Eyes with an IOP > 18 mm Hg on maximum medications, those with IOP < 6 mm Hg, or need for further intervention for IOP control were considered failures. center dot RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes of children with PCG were randomized into either the 360-GATT group (22 eyes) or the 180-GATT group (30 eyes) and followed up for at least 1 year. The median follow-up duration was 22.5 months (range: 12-30 months). IOP fell by 49% and 20.5% with 360-GATT and 180-GATT, respectively, with the final IOP being significantly lower in the former group (P = .0003). For absolute success, the cumulative survival was superior with 360-GATT for both criterion A and B at 1 year (P = .009). Average cup-to-disc ratio, corneal diameter, and axial length reversal were significant in the 360-GATT group but not in the 180-GATT group. center dot CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the superior efficacy of circumferential GATT for IOP control in eyes with congenital glaucoma.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects motor function due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. It presents significant challenges, impacting millions worldwide with symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, leading to decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is multifaceted, involving complex interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and aging, with oxidative stress playing a central role in neuronal degeneration. Glutathione S-Transferase enzymes are critical in the cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress, catalysing the conjugation of the antioxidant glutathione to various toxic compounds, thereby facilitating their detoxification. Recent research underscores the importance of Glutathione S-Transferase in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, revealing that genetic polymorphisms in Glutathione S-Transferase genes influence the risk and progression of the disease. These genetic variations can affect the enzymatic activity of Glutathione S-Transferase, thereby modulating an individual's capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, which are implicated in Parkinson's disease neuropathological processes. Moreover, biochemical studies have elucidated the role of Glutathione S-Transferase in not only maintaining cellular redox balance but also in modulating various cellular signalling pathways, highlighting its neuroprotective potential. From a therapeutic perspective, targeting Glutathione S-Transferase pathways offers promising avenues for the development of novel treatments aimed at enhancing neuroprotection and mitigating disease progression. This review explores the evident and hypothesized roles of Glutathione S-Transferase in Parkinson's disease, providing a comprehensive overview of its importance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Diploid mammalian genome has paired alleles for each gene; typically allowing for equal expression of the two alleles within the cell/tissue. However, genetic regulatory elements and epigenetic modifications can disrupt this equality, leading to preferential expression of one allele. Examining high-confidence allele-specific expression (ASE) is vital for understanding genetic variations and their impact on major diseases like cancers and diabetes. ASE analysis not only aids in disease prognosis and diagnosis but also helps to identify regulatory mechanisms operating within the genome. While advances in sequencing technologies have greatly improved our understanding of ASE, challenges remain in estimating it accurately. In this article, we reviewed methods for detecting ASE using both bulk RNASeq and single-cell RNASeq data to provide deeper insights beyond the mere prediction of ASE genes. Fundamentally, ASE detection methods are data-driven and can be classified according to type of data used. Some methods utilize both, DNA genotyping information and RNASeq while others rely solely on RNASeq data. This article offers a comparative analysis of these methods and compilation of repositories providing valuable insights.

AB  - Purpose:To describe the use of crescentic autograft as a graft salvage technique for inadvertently undersized donor lenticules in superficial anterior lamellar keratoplasty (SALK).Methods:A prospective interventional study included 5 eyes of 4 patients who underwent SALK and had an inadvertently undersized donor lenticule. The described technique involves the preparation of a crescent-shaped graft from the host lenticule itself that is matched to fit into the remaining bare recipient stromal bed.Results:At 6-week follow-up, the crescentic autograft was uniformly epithelized along with the donor tissue. There were no incidences of graft dehiscence, rejection, or infection.Conclusions:Crescentic autograft from the host lenticule offers a simple, easy-to perform, and unique technique to manage cases of undersized donor lenticules in SALK with no additional risks.

AB  - Objective: Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), commonly called pink eye, saw an alarming increase in incidence from July to September 2023 in different parts of India. Pink eye occurrences had reportedly increased three to four times more than in prior years, raising concerns among the community and healthcare professionals. This study aimed to identify the aetiological agent associated with AHC in 2023, genetically characterize the agent and describe the clinical presentation. Methods: From July to September 2023, 300 ocular and throat swab samples were collected from patients with AHC across various regions of India, including Maharashtra, Daman & Diu, Delhi, Lucknow, and Hyderabad. These samples represented a diverse geographic spread of the condition. The swabs were examined for qRT-PCR analyses, to detect adenovirus and enterovirus. Following this, conserved regions within the enteroviral 5 '-UTR and VP2/3 C gene were further investigated for serotype identification. Results: Enterovirus was found in 52.6 % (158 out of 300) of the patients. Among the enterovirus-positive samples, coxsackievirus-A24 was present in every positive sample. Conclusion: The rise in AHC cases in India in 2023 was attributed to the Coxsackievirus-A24 strain GIV C5. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - center dot PURPOSE: To assess apposition of posterior capsule (PC) to intraocular lens (IOL) optic in ultraviolet (UV)/ozone surface modified IOL and its impact on neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy rate and visual quality. center dot DESIGN: Prospective interventional case series. center dot METHODS: The study enrolled 100 eyes implanted with UV/ozone surface modified hydrophobic acrylic IOL during phacoemulsification. The primary outcome measure was PC-optic apposition on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). Secondary outcomes were Nd:YAG capsulotomy and visual quality (ray-tracing aberrometry). Follow-up was performed on postoperative day (POD) 1, at 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years. center dot RESULTS: Complete PC-optic apposition was observed in 4% of cases on POD1, which increased to 75% at 2 years. PC configuration in cases with PC-optic non- apposition was smooth (34.4%) or wavy (65.6%) on ASOCT; initial smooth PC was associated with significantly higher incidence of PC-optic apposition at 2 years (p = 0.028). At 2 years, visual quality was significantly better in cases with complete PC-optic apposition in terms of Strehl ratio ( P = .029), modulation transfer function (MTF) ( P = 0.016), root mean square (RMS) aberrations ( P = .024) and higher order aberrations (HOAs) ( P = 0.043). A significant positive correlation was observed between height of interface fluid and total RMS (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.221; P = .027) and HOAs (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.198; P = .048). PCO developed in 7% of cases (7/100); of these, 6 cases had persistent PC-optic non- apposition. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was required in 3% (3/100) cases; all of these cases had persistent PC- optic non-apposition. center dot CONCLUSIONS: Long-term complete PC-optic apposition was observed in 75% of patients implanted with UV/ozone surface-modified IOLs. Complete PC-optic apposition is associated with lower Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate and superior visual quality. (Am J Ophthalmol 2025;270: 113-119. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intricately tied to the impairment of neurons, crucial for neurological functions. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying AD development remains elusive due to its multifaceted aetiology. Vitamin deficiency has emerged as a notable contributor to AD onset and progression, exerting a significant influence on brain function. To explore this link, we conducted a thorough review using PubMed, Web of Science and MEDLINE databases to gather literature on average vitamin concentrations in people with AD and healthy controls. Applying frequentist network meta-analysis techniques, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) in vitamin concentrations between AD and control groups, both directly and indirectly. Our analysis, based on 67 articles, revealed statistically significant findings for various vitamins. Notably, vitamin C displayed the most substantial difference in average concentration between AD and control groups, supported by a high p-score of 0.92. Other vitamins that showed significant differences included vitamin D, folate, vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin B12. Moreover, by considering alternative reference groups of vitamins, we derived indirect estimates, which further emphasised the role of vitamins in AD pathology. The ranking of vitamins based on their discrepancy in concentration between AD and control groups underscored the importance of vitamin C, followed by vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, vitamin A and vitamin B12. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis highlights the potential significance of vitamin levels in understanding AD pathology. This underscores avenues for further research and potential therapeutic interventions targeting vitamin deficiencies in people with AD, potentially offering new strategies for managing the disease.

AB  - Machine learning and its specialized forms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, are increasingly being used for detecting and managing gastrointestinal conditions. Recent advancements involve using Artificial Neural Network models to enhance predictive accuracy for severe lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleeding outcomes, including the need for surgery. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI)-guided predictive models have shown promise in improving management outcomes. While much literature focuses on AI in early neoplasia detection, this review highlights AI's role in managing LGI and small bowel disorders, including risk stratification for LGI bleeding, quality control, evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, and video capsule endoscopy reading. Overall, the integration of AI into routine clinical practice is still developing, with ongoing research aimed at addressing current limitations and gaps in patient care.

AB  - Undoubtedly, Acinetobacter baumannii is a major ESKAPE pathogen that poses a significant threat to public health, causing severe nosocomial infections with high mortality rates in healthcare settings. Due to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance, only a limited number of antibiotics remain effective against infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The discovery of new class of antibiotic molecules still lags behind the rate of growing worldwide burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To expedite the discovery of new therapeutic molecules, we have focused on HisC from A. baumannii (AbHisC), a crucial enzyme involved in the seventh step of histidine biosynthesis. This pathway is absent in humans. We have employed the advanced computational techniques to target this promising drug target. AbHisC was cloned, overexpressed, and purified. Three distinct sets of libraries containing similar to 60,000 natural compounds from ZINC database were screened against AbHisC using Schrodinger's glide module software. Based on the docking score and glide energy, top 25 hits were further subjected to induced fit (IF) docking. Top four out of the twenty five compounds from IF docking were subjected to 100ns molecular dynamics simulations, and it was observed that salvianolic acid B (SA-B) (a naturally occurring compound) complex with AbHisC, was found to be extremely stable. The glide energy and docking score of SA-B were -88.59 kcal/mol and -10.4 kcal/mol. SA-B was also found to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine indicating its binding to the target. The dissociation constant calculated using Surface Plasmon Resonance was found to be 3.4x10(-9) M. Based on these results we can conclude that SA-B can serve as the potential inhibitor of AbHisC that can further form the basis of structure based drug design against this deadly pathogen.

AB  - A series of semisynthetic noscapine-urea congeners (7a-7h) as potential tubulin-binding agents are being developed by integrating a urea pharmacophore at the C-9 position of the noscapine scaffold. Their binding affinity to tubulin was predicted through molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the MMPBSA approach. These molecules were subsequently chemically synthesized and assessed using breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). Both the docking score and the predicted binding free energy ( Delta G bind,pred ) revealed that urea congeners had a stronger affinity towards tubulin than noscapine and effectively inhibited the proliferation of all cancer cell types without affecting normal healthy cells. The results indicated that compound 7g exhibited the most promise and was chosen for further studies. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 7g at its IC50 concentration showed morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, fragmented nuclei, and the presence of apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis induction was further confirmed by flow cytometry. Moreover, the tubulin binding assay revealed a greater binding affinity with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 42 +/- 2.4 mu M for compound 7g . The number of MCF-7 cells engrafted as breast tumors in nude mice was found to be reduced significantly without any adverse effects. Noscapine is already in clinical trials, but the urea noscapine congener offers an advantage because of its increased potency without impacting the nontoxic profile of noscapine.

AB  - Introduction Onco-anaesthesia is a specialised branch of anaesthesia dedicated to enhancing outcomes, prioritising patient safety and improving the overall care of patients with cancer during surgery. We outline the global epidemiology of cancer, emphasising the necessity for this subspecialty, and discuss the criteria supporting its establishment. Methods We performed searches of electronic databases to identify relevant peer-reviewed publications. The search was designed to capture a wide range of study types, including randomised controlled trials; retrospective studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews. The titles and abstracts were screened to identify publications relevant to onco-anaesthesia, cancer recurrence and return to intended therapy. The reference lists were manually reviewed to identify relevant papers for consideration. Results This review highlights the growth of onco-anaesthesia over the past decade. Research opportunities abound in areas such as: the impact of anaesthesia on cancer recurrence; the use of enhanced recovery after surgery programmes; patient blood management; peri-operative nutrition; techniques for modulating peri-operative inflammatory responses; and strategies to reduce the time to return to intended oncological treatment. Discussion By integrating various subspecialties within oncology centres, onco-anaesthesia ensures a thorough and holistic approach to both curative and palliative cancer care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and providing better support for families and caregivers throughout the peri-operative period.

AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the prevalence of psychiatric morbidities in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to identify any risk factors.MethodsSurvivors of ALL, who had completed their treatment, atleast two or more years ago and now were 6-18 y old were enrolled on the study. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. KID) screening test for psychiatric problems was applied to all. If they had screening results positive for a particular disorder then the M.I.N.I KID standard test for that particular disorder was applied. The treatment details were noted from the records.ResultsEighty-nine survivors of ALL were enrolled. Of these, 19 (21.3%) had a psychiatric diagnosis. On multivariate analysis seizures, fears, stress and hospitalizations during treatment increased the risk of adverse psychiatric outcomes in survivorship.ConclusionsThe cancer survivors can have psychiatric problems even after completion of treatment and many easily modifiable factors contribute to the same.

AB  - Aluminium is a common metallic toxicant that easily penetrates the brain and exerts severe pathological effects e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegeneration. Eugenol is a natural phenolic compound possessing numerous therapeutic properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. The compound has also been reported to interfere with important transcription factors like STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B. Thus, the present study intended to explore the therapeutic potential of eugenol in aluminium neurotoxicity. Rats were administered AlCl3 (100 mg/kg b. wt., orally) and eugenol (200 mg/kg b. wt., orally) alone or in combination for 45 days. The results revealed that AlCl3 administration increases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein oxidation (PO) along with decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and glutathione (GSH) content in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain. Moreover, AlCl3 induces neuronal loss and astroglial activation in both brain areas. The study further revealed that AlCl3 also increases the expression of transcription factors STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B in neurons and astrocytes of the cortex and hippocampus. However, co-administration of eugenol with AlCl3 restored the enzymatic activities of AChE, SOD and CAT, and GSH content, and rescued the cortex and hippocampus from LPO, PO, neuronal loss and astroglial activation. Furthermore, the study reported that eugenol reverses the expression pattern of STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B in AlCl3-intoxicated rats. In conclusion, the study suggests that eugenol ameliorates oxidative stress, neuronal loss and reactive astrogliosis in aluminium-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting signalling molecules, STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B.

AB  - We sought to evaluate the intracardiac morphology and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with double inlet right ventricle (DIRV) on multidetector CT angiography. A retrospective search of our departmental database was conducted from January 2014 to January 2023 to identify patients with a diagnosis of DIRV on CT angiography. The intracardiac anatomy and associated cardiovascular abnormalities were systematically evaluated. Patients with a common atrioventricular valve were excluded. DIRV was diagnosed in 41 patients (36 males, 5 females; mean age at imaging: 7.4 years [range: 4 months-30 years]). Mirror-imaged viscero-atrial arrangement was observed in 12/41 (29.3%) while right isomerism and left isomerism were seen in 6/41 (14.6%) and 2/41 (4.9%) patients respectively. Hypoplastic left ventricular cavity was seen in 39/41 (95.1%) patients. AV valve straddling was observed in 40/41 (97.6%) patients. Atrial septal defect was seen in 28/41 (68.3%) patients. All (100%) patients had presence of ventricular septal defect. Twisted atrioventricular connections were seen in 4/41 (9.8%) patients. The most common ventriculo-arterial morphology was presence of double outlet right ventricle (DORV) seen in 25/41 (61%) patients. Some degree of pulmonary outflow obstruction was seen in 24/41 (58.5%) patients. Systemic venous anomalies, pulmonary venous anomalies and coronary artery anomalies were observed in 13/41 (31.7%), 6/41 (14.6%) and 8/41 (19.5%) patients. DIRV is a type of single ventricle congenital heart disease associated with an array of cardiovascular abnormalities, most commonly DORV and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction. The knowledge of associated anomalies is imperative for preoperative planning. CT angiography allows for detailed anatomical evaluation of DIRV and associated cardiovascular anomalies which may positively impact surgical management in these patients.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematological malignancies. Recently, CAR-T has been used in refractory auto-immune diseases with initial encouraging results. In this systematic review, we examined the safety and efficacy of CAR-T in patients with refractory auto-immune diseases. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus search revealed 1552 articles, of which 24 were included for the final analysis. 80 patients with autoimmune diseases received CAR-T cell therapy, of which 52 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 16 patients had systemic sclerosis, 7 patients had idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, 2 patient had anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, 2 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 patient had Sjogren's disease. 44 patients got CD-19 CAR-T and 36 patients got BCMA/CD-19 compound CAR-T. All the patients achieved an immunosuppression-free state at the last follow-up. Of the 47 patients with follow-up data, 79 patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 4 patients developed neurotoxicity. None of the patients had fatal adverse events with CAR-T cell therapy. CAR-T appears to be safe and effective in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases. Future studies are crucial to further validate these findings, explore long-term outcomes, and refine the treatment protocols to enhance efficacy and safety.

AB  - Background and aimsAlthough beneficial in reducing the risk of bacterial infections in patients with advanced decompensated cirrhosis after upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, the utility of prophylactic antibiotics in those with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis is not known. We studied if prophylactic antibiotics can be withheld in this cohort.MethodsThis was a single-centre, open-label randomised-controlled-trial with non-inferiority design. Patients of Child-Pugh A cirrhosis with upper-GI bleed and hemodynamic stability were randomised to receive either no prophylactic antibiotics (test-group) or ceftriaxone [standard of care (SOC)] for 72 h alongside standard medical management. The primary outcome was infection at day-5 in both arms. Secondary outcomes included failure to control bleed, mortality at day-5, and at 6 weeks.ResultsEligible patients (n = 180; mean age 45.1 +/- 13.1 years, 76.9% males; median MELDNa 9 [interquartile-range: 7-12]) of predominant non-viral etiology (alcohol: 43.4%; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: 21.7%) were randomised, of whom outcomes could be reliably assessed for 172 and 140 patients at 5-day and 6-week follow-up, respectively. Rate of day-5 infections in test-group [7.0% (95% CI 2.8-15.1%)] was non-inferior to SOC arm [11.6% (95% CI 6.02-20.8%); absolute risk difference: -4.7% (95% CI -13.3% to 4.0%; non-inferior at 10% margin)]. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis following post-bleed ascites was the most common site of infection in both groups (10/16; 66.7%). Rates of failure to control bleed [0% vs 4.9; absolute-risk-difference: -4.6% (95% CI -9.1% to 0.2%)], day-5 mortality [0% vs 2.5%; absolute-risk-difference: -2.3% (-5.5% to 0.9%)], and 6-week mortality [1.4% vs 2.5%; absolute-risk-difference: -1.6% (-6.5% to 3.2%)] were comparable in both arms.ConclusionAmong patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis with hemodynamic stability, withholding prophylactic antibiotics after upper GI bleed was not associated with increased risk of post-bleed infections.

AB  - Rationale: Early mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is due to hematoma volume (HV) expansion, and there are no effective treatments available other than reduction in blood pressure. Tranexamic acid (TXA) a hemostatic drug that is widely available and safe can be a cost-effective treatment for ICH, if proven efficacious.Hypothesis: Administration of TXA in ICH patients when given within 4.5 h of symptom onset will reduce early mortality at 30 days.Design: Indian Trial of Tranexamic acid in Spontaneous Intracerebral Haemorrhage (INTRINSIC trial) is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, trial enrolling patients aged more than 18 years presenting with non-traumatic ICH within 4.5 h of symptom onset or when last seen well. Study participants received 2 g of TXA administered within 45 min while control group received standard of care. Intensive blood pressure reduction as per INTERACT 2 protocol is followed is done in both groups. Study plans to recruit 3400 patients. Primary outcome is mortality at day 30. Secondary outcomes are radiological reduction in HV at 24 h from baseline, neurological impairment at day 7 or earlier (if discharged), and assessments of dependency and quality of life at day 90.Summary: If proven to be beneficial, TXA will have a major impact on medical management of ICH.Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry India (CTRI/2023/03/050224) and Clinical Trials.gov (NCT05836831).

Methods: From September 2018 to December 2023, we enrolled 745 individuals including probands with dystonia and family members, in the Indian Movement Disorder Registry and Biobank. Clinical and demographic data were captured on a REDCap platform. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on DNA specimens obtained from 267 individuals with isolated, combined or complex dystonia. Variants were classified according to joint guidelines of American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP). Results: The mean age of the WES cohort was 33.8 +/- 16.2 years, and mean age at onset (AAO) of dystonia was 25.6 +/- 17.7 years. 62.2% had isolated dystonia, 7.9% combined and 29.2% had complex phenotypes. WES identified pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variants in 54 patients (20.2%) including 14 novel variants in known dystonia genes. Variants in THAP1 were most common followed by PANK2, GLB1, PLA2G6, TOR1A, ANO3, VPS16, SGCE, SPG7, FTL and other genes. Multifocal/generalized distribution of dystonia [OR: 4.1; 95% CI 1.4-12.2, P = 0.011] and family history [OR: 4.3; 95% CI 2.1-8.9, P < 0.001] were associated with positive yield on WES. Conclusion: THAP1 was the most frequent dystonia associated gene in this cohort. Singleton WES identifiedpotentially pathogenic variants in approximately one out of five patients tested, and contributed to management decisions in 4%.

AB  - User satisfaction with Assistive Technology (AT) is one of the crucial factors in the success of any AT service. The current study aimed to estimate satisfaction with AT and the reasons for dissatisfaction and unsuitability among persons with functional difficulties in India. Using the WHO Rapid Assistive Technology Assessment tool, a cross-sectional study was conducted in eight districts, representing four zones of India. Multi-stage cluster random sampling and probability proportional to size techniques were used to select smaller administrative units from the larger ones. Satisfaction was reported in terms of assistive products and service delivery. In total, 8486 participants were surveyed out of which 8964 individuals were enumerated with a response rate of 94.6%. Around 22.2% (1888) of participants had functional difficulties and reported using AT, out of which 3.9% (74) were dissatisfied with their products. The assistive products, assessment and training, and repair and maintenance-related services were reported to be satisfied by approximately 92.2% (1740), 88.4% (1669), and 85.2% (1609) of respondents, respectively. Further, 3.2% (61) and 3.7% (70) of respondents reported that their AT was not suitable for home and public environments, respectively. According to 2.8% (53) respondents, their AT did not assist them in executing daily living activities. Discomfort (56.6%), poor fitting (37.7%), low quality of service (20.7%), and poor aesthetic values (18.9%) were identified as reasons for dissatisfaction. Satisfaction was good for AT received from friends and family but was poor for those received from the public sector. The study shows that overall satisfaction and suitability with AT were high among users with functional difficulties, but few have reported barriers to effective device use and facing challenges in accessing repair and follow-up services.

AB  - Survival outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF) based on their disease etiology are not well described. Here, we provide one-year mortality outcomes of 10850 patients with HF (mean age = 59.9 years, 31% women) in India. Ischemic heart disease (71.9%), dilated cardiomyopathy (17.3), rheumatic heart disease (5.4), non-rheumatic valvular heart disease (1.9), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (0.8), congenital heart disease (0.7), peri-partum cardiomyopathy (0.5), restrictive cardiomyopathy (0.4), and infective endocarditis (0.1) were the main disease etiologies. Mortality rate per 100-person years of follow-up varied from 13.8 (95% CI: 6.2-30.7) in peri-partum cardiomyopathy to 92.9 (46.5-185.9) in infective endocarditis. Compared to ischemic heart disease, the mortality was two to five times higher in rheumatic heart disease (HR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6-2.4), congenital heart disease (2.9; 1.9-4.2), and infective endocarditis (4.8; 2.4-9.8). The wide variations in mortality rate in HF patients may bring possible clinical applicability of risk stratification.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a heme-containing mammalian enzyme that is found in the extracellular fluids of animals including plasma, saliva, airway epithelial and nasal lining fluids, milk, tears, and gastric juices. LPO uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to convert substrates into oxidized products. Previous structural studies have shown that H2O2, CO, and CN are bound to LPO at the distal heme cavity by coordinating with heme iron. The structure of the complex of LPO with NO shows that NO also binds to LPO at the distal heme cavity and forms a coordinate linkage with heme iron. The structure shows that the nitrogen atom of NO is linked to heme iron at a distance of 1.97 while the oxygen atom is attached to the N epsilon 2 atom of His109 at a distance of 2.23 & Aring;. On the other hand, N atom of NO is located with an interatomic distance of 3.25 & Aring; allowing a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the N epsilon 2 atom of Gln105. A comparison of the bindings of NO, CO, CN, and H2O2 in coordination with heme iron indicates stereochemical compatibility of the distal heme cavity for the binding of diatomic molecules. However, notable differences are observed in their orientations in the distal heme cavity indicating functional differences. The bindings of NO, CO, and CN by coordinating with heme iron result in the inhibition of LPO while the binding of H2O2 to heme iron produces an intermediate of LPO known as Compound I.

AB  - The emergence of new coronavirus variants and concerns about vaccine effectiveness against these novel variants emphasize the need for broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting conserved coronaviral non-structural proteins. Accordingly, a virtual library of 178 putative inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like protease (PLpro) was compiled through a systematic review of published literature and subsequently screened using molecular docking. Selected hits were analyzed for protease inhibitory activities, binding strength, and antiviral activities against HCoV229E-based surrogate system and subsequently against SARS-CoV-2 for validation. Differences in potential modes of action were investigated using an HCoV229E-based system, combined with in silico and biophysical methods against SARS-CoV-2 system. Of the 178 hits, 13 molecules showed superior docking scores against PLpro and met the inclusion criteria for further investigations. Of these, seven showed notable inhibitory activities against PLpro. Particularly, both Psoralidin and Corylifol-A exhibited superior and, importantly, dual activities against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro. Both molecules were found to be biologically active against HCoV229E and SARS-CoV-2; however, Psoralidin exhibited more consistent effects and was relatively well-tolerated. Detailed in silico analyses of their interactions with the two proteases identified differences in their modes of action, primarily due to differences in their binding of PLpro. Based on these findings, we propose Psoralidin as a potential candidate for further development as a broad-spectrum antiviral and Corylifol-A as an ideal candidate for lead optimization.

AB  - PurposeEarly diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (PC) are crucial for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Newer imaging modalities like prostate-specific membrane antigen PET have shown superior diagnostic performance in detecting PC and clinically significant PC (csPC). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence on the diagnostic performance of PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy in detecting PC and csPC.Patients and MethodsThe study followed the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. Using a predefined search strategy, 3 databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were systematically searched using appropriate keywords. A meta-analysis was conducted using diagnostic accuracy parameters of the included studies. Risk of bias assessment was done using the QUADAS-2 tool.ResultsOut of 378 articles, 20 were assessed for full-text screening and 10 articles with 874 patients were finally included. Eight studies reported a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.90 (95%confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.95), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.57-0.99), 12.3 (95% CI, 1.5-98.9), 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05-0.20), and 117 (95% CI, 12-1178), respectively, for detecting PC using PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96). Similarly, 6 studies reported a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.94), 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49-0.79), 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6-4.1), 0.17 (95% CI, 0.09-0.31), and 15 (95% CI, 6-41), respectively, for detecting csPC using PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy with area under summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88).ConclusionsPSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy has a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting PC and csPC in patients with clinical suspicion of PC, and provides a 1-stop solution for early diagnosis and staging of PC.

AB  - Introduction: Solute carrier family transporters (SLCs), crucial for nutrient and trace element uptake in the placenta, play a significant role in fetal growth and development. Their dysregulation is associated with various pregnancy disorders. However, a comprehensive understanding of their role and regulation in placental function and pregnancy complications is still a largely unexplored area, making this study novel and significant. Methods: We performed a rigorous meta-analysis of publicly available NCBI GEO microarray and RNA-Seq datasets followed by bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed SLCs in PE and IUGR. The identified SLCs were then validated using qPCR on PE placental samples, ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of preeclampsia (PE) and Intrauterine Growth restriction (IUGR) datasets revealed significant associations between specific SLC transporters with disease pathology, identified by studying differentially expressed SLCs. Subsequent validation using qPCR on placental samples confirmed considerable downregulation of SLC6A8, SLC16A10, SLC25A3, and SLC29A3, highlighting their dysregulation in the pathogenesis of PE and IUGR. Discussion: The significant downregulation of SLC6A8, SLC16A10, SLC25A3, and SLC29A3 observed by bioinformatics analyses and validated by qPCR indicates atypical expression of these SLCs in gestational disorders. Our findings underscore the potential contribution of multiple SLC gene families to the development of placental pathologies associated with diverse pregnancy complications.

AB  - Introduction: Heavy metals exposure is a known carcinogen in humans. The impact of heavy metals in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear with scant available literature. Though previous studies have evaluated the role of heavy metals in RCC, majority of those studies have evaluated either single or few heavy metals in urine. None of the prior studies have evaluated an extensive panel of heavy metals in blood, urine, and tissue in the same patient along with the serum oxidation status and gene expression to establish a cause- and-effect relationship. This study aims to evaluate the role of extensive panel of heavy metals, oxidative status, and gene expression in RCC. Methodology: This observational study recruited RCC patients who visited our tertiary care centre from 2019 to 2023. Age matched healthy volunteers were included as controls. Blood, urine, and tissue samples (tumor and adjacent normal tissue) were collected from RCC patients. Levels of arsenic, copper, manganese, selenium, cadmium, lead, and mercury were measured in each of the samples. Serum oxidative stress markers like glutathione peroxidase (GPX), lipid peroxidase (LPO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Genetic expression of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD]), and glutathione peroxidase ( GPX] ) genes were measured in the tumor tissue and adjacent normal parenchyma. Results: 150 cases and 150 age matched controls were enrolled. RCC cases had elevated blood levels of arsenic (P = 0.02), copper (P = 0.01), manganese (P < 0.001), cadmium (P < 0.001), lead (P < 0.001), and mercury (P = 0.02) compared to controls. Urine levels of selenium (P = 0.02), mercury (P = 0.03), and lead (P = 0.04) were higher in cases. Reduced levels of serum GPx (P = 0.02) and higher levels of LPO (P = 0.04) were detected in cases. Elevated levels of copper (P = 0.03), manganese (P = 0.002), selenium (P < 0.001), and cadmium (P < 0.001) were found in the adjacent normal parenchyma compared to the tumor tissue. VHL (P = 0.03) and oxidative stress gene expressions were lower in the tumour tissue compared to the normal parenchyma. Conclusion: Elevated levels of heavy metals in the blood, urine, tissue, and imbalance in the serum oxidative status along with downregulated tumor suppressor VHL and oxidative stress genes in the tumor tissues likely explain the carcinogenic role of heavy metals in RCC. Environmental exposure is the main cause of heavy metal toxicity. Mitigating the environmental exposure of heavy metals and thereby their toxicity might play a role in cancer prevention.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the efficacy of scleral buckling in the hands of vitreo-retina (VR) fellows under training in eyes with retinal detachment associated with retinal dialysis and analyze the patient and retinal characteristics in these eyes. Methods: We carried out a retrospective consecutive case review at a tertiary eye care center in North India. Records of all the patients who had undergone scleral buckling (SB) for retinal dialysis-associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachment by VR fellows (with less than 2 years' experience) between January 2017 and January 2020 were reviewed. Results: Fifty-three eyes of 53 patients with a mean age of 20.77 years were analyzed. Of the patients, 73.58% were males. History of eye trauma was present in 71.69% patients. A total of 21 residents operated these 53 eyes. SB was able to achieve retinal attachment in a single surgery in 84.9% (45/53) eyes. Mean preoperative best corrected visual acuity was 1.9 +/- 1.05 log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), which improved postoperatively to 1.07 +/- 0.72 logMAR (P < 0.001). Surgical success rate was 85.71% (24/28) in eyes with no proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), 66.66% (2/3) in eyes with PVR-A, 91.66% (11/12) in eyes with PVR-B, and 80% (8/10) in eyes with PVR-C1. Fifty-two eyes had a single dialysis and one eye had two separate dialysis. Six eyes had giant retinal dialysis (dialysis greater than 3 clock hours) and all were due to trauma. Five patients had retinal dialysis in the fellow eye and were diagnosed with bilateral idiopathic retinal dialysis. Conclusion: Scleral buckling is a safe and effective management for retinal dialysis retinal detachment even in the hands of VR fellows under training.

AB  - Background: Financial toxicity is the detrimental impact of health care costs that must be mitigated to achieve universal health coverage. Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) is widely used to measure financial toxicity but does not capture patient perspectives of unaffordable health care costs. Financial hardship (FH), a patient-reported outcome measure, is currently underutilized but may be an important adjunct metric. The authors compare CHE to FH as metrics evaluating financial toxicity. Methods: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted across 3 public and private tertiary-care hospitals in India. Adult surgical trauma inpatients in plastic and orthopedic surgery departments were assessed. The development of CHE, health expenditures >10% of annual income, and FH, the patient-reported impact of financial toxicity in the form of asset liquidation, debt acquisition, and job loss, were compared by the health system and using logistic regression models. Results: Among 744 surgical trauma patients, low income, longer hospital stays, and increased injury severity were significantly associated with the likelihood of incurring CHE and FH (P<0.05). Only FH was significantly associated with lack of insurance (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 1.14-2.71). Public hospitals had higher rates of FH than CHE (55% versus 23%). Private hospitals had more CHE than FH (53% versus 32%). Conclusions: FH is an important metric of financial toxicity that provides important adjunct information to CHE for at-risk populations. FH is particularly informative for public institutions with low direct medical costs. Nuanced utilization of CHE and FH provides a more comprehensive, patient-oriented approach to evaluating unaffordable health care costs that can help shape financial risk protection policy.

AB  - Introduction: The left atrium (LA) dilates and its function decreases as a chronic secondary change in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). LA strain is a more sensitive measure of LV filling pressure than LA volume and can be used to predict the functional capacity in HCM. Objective: To analyze LA strain in patients with HCM and its correlation with exercise tolerance. Methods: A total of 113 patients with HCM were enrolled. All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation, 24-h Holter monitoring, exercise stress testing, two-dimensional echocardiography with LA strain analysis using speckle tracking imaging. Assessment of functional capacity was done in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs). HCM patients with METS >6.0 were included in Group A while those with METS <= 6.0 were included Group B. Correlation of various parameters of LA strain (left atrial reservoir strain [LASr], left atrial conduit strain [LAScd], and left atrial contraction strain [LASct]) was done with functional capacity. Results: The mean age of the study population was 47 +/- 10.77 years with the majority of them being males (71.9%). Group B patients had significantly lower LASr (12.95% +/- 8.61% vs. 22.16% +/- 16%; p < 0.001), LAScd (-7.28% +/- 6.29% vs. -12.74% +/- 8.40%; p < 0.001), and LASct (-7.44 +/- 4.46 vs. -11.19 +/- 6.53; p < 0.001). Multivariable linear regression analysis reported LASr to be an independent predictor of METs and had a quadratic relationship with log-odds with negative linear and positive quadratic coefficients. LASr was the strongest echocardiographic predictor of reduced METS with an AUC of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.88), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 82.9%. Conclusion: LA strain parameters are associated with functional capacity in patients with HCM with lower LA strain values being associated with poor functional capacity.

AB  - ObjectivesPain is the foremost complication of chronic pancreatitis (CP), affecting about 70% of patients. However, the pathophysiological understanding and management of CP-related pain are complex, likely as patients have diverse "pain phenotypes" responding differently to treatment. This study aims to develop a bedside test panel to identify distinct pain phenotypes, investigate the temporal evolution, and determine whether they can be used to predict treatment response.MethodsThe INPAIN study is an international, multicenter, observational, longitudinal cohort study consisted of 4 substudies. The studies will prospectively enroll 400 CP patients (50 without pain and 350 with pain) and 50 control subjects, conducting biannual observations for 4 years. The test panel is consisted of comprehensive subjective and objective assessment parameters. Statistical analysis strategies differ across the substudies. A model to predict treatment efficacy will be developed using various machine learning techniques, including an artificial intelligence approach, with internal cross-validation.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the corneal biomechanical parameters, visual outcome, and epithelial remodeling after small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for low to moderate myopia. Design: Prospective, interventional, randomized, comparative study. Methods: Eighty eyes of 40 patients undergoing bilateral SMILE or PRK for low to moderate myopia (<-5 D SE) were included. They were divided into two groups based on the planned refractive surgery. Visual acuity, corneal biomechanics using Corvis-ST, epithelial mapping via anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and higher-order aberrations were recorded both preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and compared. Results: At 6 months follow-up, the corrected distance visual acuity as well as the postoperative spherical equivalent of both the groups were comparable (P = 0.13 and P = 0.32, respectively). The biomechanical parameters like deformation amplitude ratio (P < 0.01), inverse concave radius (P = 0.006), integrated ratio (P < 0.01), stress-strain index (P < 0.01), Ambrosio's relational thickness (ArTH) (P < 0.01), and corneal biomechanical index-laser vision correction (P = 0.02) were altered more in the SMILE group than in the PRK group, while the biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure (P = 0.16) was comparable. Epithelial remodeling (P = 0.59), higher-order aberrations (P = 0.53), and stromal keratocyte loss (P = 0.16) in both the groups were comparable. Conclusion: Both SMILE and PRK are comparably effective procedures for correction of low to moderate myopia in terms of visual outcomes; however, the corneal biomechanical stability in PRK is superior than that in SMILE.

AB  - Angioid streaks are irregular breaks in the brittle Bruch's membrane and commonly present as pigmented linear lines radiating from the optic disc. They may be associated with systemic disease in up to 50% of the patients. Systemic diseases such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Paget's disease, and hemoglobinopathies are commonly associated with angioid streaks. However, they may be idiopathic in a small number of cases. Patients may be asymptomatic until complications such as choroidal neovascular membrane and subretinal hemorrhage involving the fovea develop. Due to the brittle nature of Bruch's membrane, even minor trauma could lead to subretinal hemorrhage in these eyes. Diagnosis is commonly made through clinical examination and investigations such as fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography. Treatment consists of management of the choroidal neovascular membrane commonly through intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections. In this review, we provide an overview of angioid streaks right from their epidemiology to their management.

AB  - Objective: Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is defined as impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation, caused by structural or functional heart diseases. We sought to assess the role of cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) as a tool to evaluate LV DD in patients with normal EF using the diastolic expansion index (DEI), as compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the gold standard. Methods: Patients presenting with atypical chest pain with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and having a normal LV ejection fraction on TTE underwent CCTA using a dual source CT scanner. Assessment of diastolic function on CCTA was done using DEI, and it was compared with TTE-derived diastolic function as per standard ASE/EACVI guidelines. DEI was measured using a dedicated postprocessing software (Syngo.via VB20, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and was calculated as a ratio of maximum LV volume (in LV end-diastole) to maximum left atrial (LA) volume (in LV end-systole), with the mean value of readings from three independent readers taken for each calculation. Results: The study included 141 patients (60 male; mean age 50.82 +/- 10.20 years; mean heart rate 84.90 +/- 16.15 beats per minute). CCTA-derived mean indexed LA volumes correlated well with TTE measurements but were larger when compared to TTE (r = 0.53, p < 0.0001). A progressive increase in LA volume index was noted with worsening DD grades. Excellent inter-observer correlation was seen between the three observers for LA volume index (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.999 [95% CI: 0.999-0.999] and for DEI 0.996 [95% CI: 0.995-0.997]). A normal LV diastolic function was predicted by a DEI > 1.57 with a specificity and sensitivity of 88.3% and 81.6%, respectively (area under curve (AUC)-0.87), whereas an abnormal LV diastolic function was predicted by DEI <1.46 with a specificity and sensitivity of 84.8% and 62.5%, respectively (AUC-0.848). There was a significant correlation between the presence of obstructive CAD and an increase in calcium score with DD grade (p = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: CCTA-derived DEI is a reliable metric for assessing LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with suspected CAD with normal ejection fraction. The presence of obstructive CAD and an increase in calcium score correlated with worsening DD grade.

AB  - The disturbances in thyroid hormones lead to altered brain metabolism, function, and cognition. Neuroimaging studies have shown structural and functional changes in hypothyroidism. Present study investigates the neurometabolite changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and associated decline cognitive function in hypothyroid patients before and after thyroxine treatment. We performed neuropsychological test and 1H MRS in hypothyroid patients (n = 25) and controls (n = 30). In addition, followup data was also collected from 19 patients treated with levo-thyroxine for 32 weeks. The concentration of the neurometabolites were calculated using LCModel. MRS data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with age and gender as covariates. A paired t-test was conducted to compare the baseline hypothyroid with the follow-up. Partial correlations were utilised to assess possible associations between neuropsychological scores and neurometabolites with age and gender as covariates. Spearman correlation was performed between thyroid hormone levels and neurometabolites. Hypothyroid patients showed an impairment in delayed recall, immediate recall of semantic, visual retention, recognition of objects memory, attention, and motor function at baseline, which improved significantly after thyroxine therapy. At baseline, patients with hypothyroidism exhibited significantly higher levels of choline compounds (GPC + PCh) [Cho]. No significant normalization of Cho levels was observed, despite achieving euthyroidism with thyroxine treatment. Cho levels showed a positive correlation with TSH in PPC and a negative correlation with T4 in DLPFC and PCC. Cho levels also showed negative correlations with delayed recall, immediate recall of semantic, visual retention memory and MMSE scores. The MRS findings show increased levels of Cho in hypothyroid patients compared to healthy controls. These Cho levels are not reversible within 32 weeks of treatment, suggesting that a longer follow-up may be needed to see if levels can be normalized.

AB  - Purpose:The management of idiopathic macular holes (iMH) has evolved over time with various modifications in surgical approach. The study aimed to survey the surgeons' preferences in the management of iMH in current times. Design:Cross-sectional descriptive survey. Methods:A 12-item questionnaire addressing the key aspects of iMH management was sent, between October 2022 to November 2022, by personal correspondence to 104 vitreoretinal specialists, actively practicing and performing iMH surgeries at various institutes in India. The responses were gathered till January 2023 and analyzed as per appropriate statistical methods. Results:Ninety-one retina specialists responded to the survey (response rate of 87.5%) with a median annual surgical load of 30 cases (range: 5-150). Most respondents had similar views on patient selection, combined phaco-vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane (ILM) staining, ILM peel initiation and propagation, tamponade, postoperative positioning, and prognostic factors. The preferred approach for peel initiation was "pinch and peel," but "scrape and peel" was equally recommended for beginners. Most respondents considered iMH >600 microns in size as large and used additional surgical maneuvers for large and failed cases such as ILM flap, large flap, macular detachment, platelet-rich plasma application, and amniotic membrane graft. The three most important visual prognostic factors were duration, preoperative vision, and MH size. Conclusions:The practice of surveyed surgeons performing iMH surgery was uniform in several aspects. There is a need to create consensus on the preferred ILM peel technique among trainee surgeons, revisit the iMH size classification, and standardize the surgical approach as per hole size and characteristics.

AB  - Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare genitourinary malignancy with a specific SS18::SSX 1/2 gene fusion in majority of the instances. The paratesticular location of this neoplasm is extremely rare and only 4 cases are reported in the literature. Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic features and molecular profile of paratesticular SS in the largest case series to date and to the best of our knowledge, and the only series to use novel SS18-SSX antibody for immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), molecular, treatment, and follow-up data of the patients were analyzed. There were 14 patients, ranging from 15 to 47 years (mean: 30 y). The tumor size ranged from 4 to 15 cm. The tumors were unilateral, solid, and homogeneous tan-white with monomorphic spindle cell histology. All 14 tumors expressed SS18-SSX and TLE1 IHC and harbored SS18 rearrangement. In addition, the tumor with multifocal SS18-SSX expression had lower break-apart signals in the FISH assay (38% of the tumor cells; range: 29% to 85%). Radical orchiectomy was performed in all 14 patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 9 patients. Follow-up was available in 9 patients. The follow-up duration ranged from 5 to 24 months (median=10 mo). Four patients died of metastatic disease (range: 5 to 16 mo) and 2 patients who are alive had metastatic disease at the last follow-up. Based on our experience with the largest series to date and aggregate of the published data, paratesticular SS has a poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy. Owing to its rarity, the differential diagnosis is wide and requires a systematic approach for ruling out key morphologic mimics aided with SS18-SSX IHC and molecular confirmation because this distinction carries important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Due to the excellent concordance of SS18-SSX IHC results with FISH results as observed in our study, we would like to suggest inclusion of SS18-SSX in the diagnostic immunohistochemistry panel of all spindle cell sarcomas where synovial sarcoma is considered as a morphologic differential. SS18-SSX-positive staining may be used as a surrogate for FISH assay in a resource-limited setting where molecular assay is not available. Furthermore, IHC has a fairly shorter turn-around-time, is less complex, and of low cost.

AB  - Neuromyotonia or Isaacs syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder secondary to hyperexcitable peripheral nerves which fire continuously causing motor unit activation and manifests clinically as cramps, muscle twitches, or visible muscle contraction associated with impaired muscle relaxation. Clinical suspicion and subsequent diagnostic work-up, including electrophysiology, aid in the diagnosis. However, when contractions are not appreciated clinically, there is a high possibility of misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis may also be attributable to a lack of knowledge of symptoms among physicians and a paucity of diagnostic modalities, hence additional tools have been sought. Here we present the case of 15-year-old girl who presented to us with complaints of painful posturing and stiffness of both hands, which was initially diagnosed and managed as dystonia without symptomatic relief. We suspected the diagnosis of neuromyotonia only after we performed neuromuscular ultrasound, which became the main guiding light to reach the diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lifitegrast 5% versus carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) 0.5% in adult patients with dry eye disease (DED).Methods:A total of 370 eligible patients with DED were randomized equally to receive twice-daily doses of a single drop in each eye of either lifitegrast 5% or CMC 0.5% for 12 weeks. Follow-up at weeks 2, 6, and 12 evaluated changes from baseline in primary [eye dryness score (EDS), ocular discomfort score (ODS), ocular surface disease index (OSDI), and tear film break-up time (TFBUT)] and secondary [Schirmer tear test (STT) score and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score] endpoints. Global improvement, safety, and tolerability were also assessed.Results:At week 2, values of ocular discomfort score, OSDI, and conjunctival redness were significantly more favorable in patients treated with lifitegrast compared to CMC. At week 6, values of all study variables were better in patients treated with lifitegrast compared to CMC; differences between the groups were statistically significant for all except photophobia. This trend was also maintained at week 12. Global improvement and tolerability were found to be better with lifitegrast than with CMC. No serious safety concerns were reported in any treatment group.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first active-controlled trial informing on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lifitegrast 5%. Significantly more favorable values for EDS (except photophobia), ODS, OSDI, TFBUT, STT score, CFS score, and conjunctival redness score were achieved at week 12 with lifitegrast 5% compared to CMC 0.5%.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the visual outcomes of implantable Collamer lens (ICL) with small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) in cases of moderate-high myopia.Methods:A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 eyes of 30 patients with moderate-high myopia (-3D to -8D with astigmatism <= 1 D) at a tertiary eye care center. Patients underwent either SMILE or ICL in both eyes and had a postoperative follow-up of 1 year.Results:The manifest refractive spherical equivalent was -5.22 +/- 1.05 D and -5.4 +/- 1.17 D in the SMILE and ICL groups, respectively (P = 0.53). The mean sphere and cylinder were comparable between the groups. The mean uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.18 +/- 0.19 logMAR to 0.03 +/- 0.07 logMAR in SMILE and 1.14 +/- 0.25 logMAR to 0.011 +/- 0.04 logMAR in the ICL group. The efficacy for SMILE was 83.3% and that for ICL was 93.3%. Safety and predictability (+/- 0.5D) for both was 100%. A significant increase was observed in ocular aberration with a decrease in modular transfer function in the eyes that underwent SMILE, whereas no significant change in the eyes that underwent ICL. A significant difference was observed in all parameters of ocular aberration except corneal trefoil, corneal astigmatism, and PSF between the two groups at the final follow-up. The contrast sensitivity at final follow-up was higher in ICL cases when compared to SMILE. The quality of vision (QoV) score suggested a better QoV with ICL; however, the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion:Both SMILE and ICL are safe in patients with moderate-high myopia. The efficacy, contrast sensitivity, and postoperative ocular aberration profile are better in cases undergoing ICL.

AB  - Purpose:The primary objective was to evaluate the clinical response of refractory cases of fungal keratitis to topical 1% posaconazole therapy.Methods:Prospective longitudinal non-randomized open label dual-cohort study of 70 eyes of refractory fungal keratitis, 35 were recruited as posaconazole treatment (PCZ) group for topical 1% posaconazole therapy and compared to 35 eyes on conventional antifungal therapy. Study parameters included demographic and treatment details, visual acuity, comprehensive slit-lamp biomicroscopy, clinical photography, ASOCT at recruitment and weekly (week 1, 2, 3 and 4 after treatment initiation). Clinical assessment included keratitis severity grade, time of healing, and healing response. Anti-fungal susceptibility testing was performed.Results:The mean age of 35 patients recruited in the PCZ treatment group was 45 +/- 17.32 years and that for the conventional treatment group was 43.22 +/- 15.04 years. Culture isolation was possible in 25 eyes (71.4%) in the PCZ treatment group, with Fusarium and Aspergillus spp. being the most common cornea pathogenic mycotic organisms. The mean healing time in the PCZ group was 27.13 +/- 5.8 days and in the conventional treatment group was 26.41 +/- 4.81 days. Healing response in the PCZ treatment showed that 27 eyes (77.14%) had healed, 3 (8.5%) had delayed healing, and 5 (14.28%) required therapeutic keratoplasty, whereas in the conventional treatment group, 26 (74.28%) healed, 2 (5.7%) had delayed healing, and 7 (20%) needed keratoplasty (P = 0.65, 0.72, 0.54, respectively). Topical 1% PCZ therapy of chronic mycotic keratitis was helpful in resolution in 85.7% of cases (30 eyes) with five eyes needing surgical intervention, which was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic therapy cohorts. Fusarium isolates showed greater susceptibility to natamycin in our study per MIC50 values, with susceptibility to the common antimycotic agents varying between the Aspergillus spp. in both PCZ treatment and conventional treatment groups. All isolates showed minimal values of MIC-50 with PCZ. Antifungal susceptibility testing in our study recruits showed that about 90% of the Fusarium spp. isolates to be best responsive to natamycin and PCZ, whereas Aspergillus niger isolates were sensitive to voriconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and PCZ, Aspergillus flavus to voriconazole and PCZ, Aspergillus fumigatus to both polyenes and triazoles. Cladosporium spp. were best sensitive to natamycin and PCZ, Penicillium spp. to natamycin and azoles. Alternaria keratitis isolates were sensitive to voriconazole and PCZ, whereas Rhizopus isolate was best sensitive to PCZ.Conclusion:Topical 1% PCZ therapy in refractory fungal keratitis was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic agents, with lower MIC-50 against the common pathogenic fungi as compared to natamycin, amphotericin B, and voriconazole.

KW  - Intraoperative aberrometry

KW  - SFIOL
AB  - Scleral-fixated intraocular lens (SFIOL) is a widely used technique for IOL implantation in patients where capsular support is insufficient. Most surgeons have shifted away from sutured to sutureless SFIOL techniques where haptics of a multifocal IOL are inserted in scleral tunnels/flaps. Large-scale publications have shown wide variation in the refractive status of eyes post-SFIOL even in the best of the hands. This is because even slight variations in the site of scleral flap/tunnel formation and tension on haptics due to the variable length of haptics placed in scleral flaps/tunnels can alter the effective lens position and induce significant residual refractive error, especially cylindrical astigmatism due to IOL tilt. Our technique aims to reduce residual refractive error after SFIOL implantation. This is achieved by using intraoperative aberrometry and adjusting haptics accordingly to achieve minimal refractive error intraoperatively.

AB  - Purpose:Utilization of multimodal imaging techniques to diagnose cases of mucolipidosis type IV (ML-IV) and report a new genetic variant.Methods:This study is a case report.Results:Case 1 involves a 4-year-old boy with corneal haziness and global developmental delay who showed an increased reflectivity of the corneal epithelium on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). In addition, neurologic evaluation was suggestive of ML-IV. Further genetics evaluation confirmed ML-IV. Histology of the button revealed a thickened epithelial basement membrane. Case 2, the younger sibling, showed a milder corneal haze with similar changes on AS-OCT prompting us to further evaluate for ML-IV by genetics (positive MCOLN1 gene mutation). Both instances highlighted varied ML-IV presentations, but a persistent feature was hyperreflective epithelium.Conclusions:Our study emphasizes AS-OCT's role in screening ML-IV and advocates the role of genetic counseling of affected parents. We present 2 South-Asian siblings with ML-IV with a new genetic variant, emphasizing the utility of detailed ophthalmic and neurologic assessments using multimodal imaging.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal beta-coronavirus that emerged in 2012. The virus is part of the WHO blueprint priority list with a concerning fatality rate of 35%. Scientific efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines, anti-viral and biotherapeutics, which are majorly directed toward the structural spike protein. However, the ongoing effort is challenging due to conformational instability of the spike protein and the evasion strategy posed by the MERS-CoV. In this study, we have expressed and purified the MERS-CoV pre-fusion spike protein in the Expi293F mammalian expression system. The purified protein was extensively characterized for its biochemical and biophysical properties. Thermal stability analysis showed a melting temperature of 58 degrees C and the protein resisted major structural changes at elevated temperature as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Immunological assessment of the MERS-CoV spike immunogen in BALB/c mice with AddaVaxTM and Imject alum adjuvants showed elicitation of high titer antibody responses but a more balanced Th1/Th2 response with AddaVaxTM squalene like adjuvant. Together, our results suggest the formation of higher-order trimeric pre-fusion MERS-CoV spike proteins, which were able to induce robust immune responses. The comprehensive characterization of MERS-CoV spike protein warrants a better understanding of MERS spike protein and future vaccine development efforts.

AB  - BackgroundThe indications for pediatric airway endoscopy are expanding and a variety of therapeutic interventions are feasible for central airway obstruction (CAO) and other central airway pathologies, apart from foreign body removal.MethodsIn this retrospective chart review from four centers, we describe the indications, procedures, outcomes, and complications of therapeutic bronchoscopic interventions in children for non foreign-body removal indications.ResultsA total of 72 children (mean age:140 [60.4] months) underwent 143 therapeutic bronchoscopic airway interventions under general anesthesia, via a rigid or flexible bronchoscope or both, between January 2015 and November 2023. 67 (93%) had CAO. The most common diagnoses were posttubercular tracheobronchial stenosis (29%) followed by central airway tumor (26%) and postintubation/posttracheostomy tracheal stenosis (26%). Airway stenosis (subglottic/tracheal/bronchial) was the commonest bronchoscopic finding (43 [59.7%]) followed by endoluminal growth/mass (21 [29.2%]). The most frequently performed procedure was airway dilatation (38, 52.7%), using balloon dilators (89.5%) or rigid bronchoscope (10.5%). Endoluminal tumor debulking was performed in 21 (29%). Assistive modalities included electrocautery (44%), mechanical debulking (10%), cryotherapy (10%), or laser (4%). Airway stent insertion alone or in combination with airway dilatation or debulking was performed in 24 (33.3%) children. The airway conduit used was supraglottic airway in 19 (26%) and rigid bronchoscope in 53 (74%) children. Immediate procedural success was observed in 66 (92%) patients. Fourteen (19.4%) patients had minor procedural complications. Thirty-three (46%) children required a repeat bronchoscopic procedure.ConclusionLike adults, multimodality therapeutic bronchoscopic airway interventions are feasible and safe in children for CAO and other central airway indications.

AB  - BackgroundTo evaluate outcomes of laparoscopic retroperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy for stage 1b3-3b cervical cancer.MethodsPathology databases searched for all para-aortic lymphadenectomy cases 2005-2016. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse baseline characteristics, cox models for treatment affect after accounting for variables, and Kaplan Meier curves for survival (STATA v15).Results191 patients had 1b3-3b cervical cancer of which 110 patients had Para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 8 (7.3%) patients stage 1b3, 82 (74.6%) stage 2b, and 20 (18.1%) stage 3b cervical cancer. Mean lymph node count 11.7 (SD7.6). The intra-operative and post-operative 30 day complication rates were 8.8% (CI: 4.3%, 15.7%) and 5.3% (CI: 1.9%, 11.2%) respectively.Para-aortic nodes were apparently positive on CT/MRI in 5/110 (5%) cases. Cancer was found in 10 (8.9%, CI: 4.3%, 15.7%) cases on histology, all received extended field radiotherapy. Only 2 were identified on pre-operative CT/MRI imaging. 3 of 10 suspected node-positive cases on CT/MRI had negative histology. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy led to alteration in staging and radiotherapy management in 8 (8%, CI: 3.7%, 14.6%) patients. Mean overall survival 42.81 months (SD = 31.79 months). Survival was significantly higher for women undergoing PAN (50.57 (SD 30.7) months) compared to those who didn't (31.27 (SD 32.5) months)Results191 patients had 1b3-3b cervical cancer of which 110 patients had Para-aortic lymphadenectomy. 8 (7.3%) patients stage 1b3, 82 (74.6%) stage 2b, and 20 (18.1%) stage 3b cervical cancer.

Survival was significantly higher for women undergoing PAN (50.57 (SD 30.7) months) compared to those who didn't (31.27 (SD 32.5) months)ConclusionLaparoscopic retroperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy is an acceptable procedure which can guide treatment in women with locally advanced cervical cancer.
   We evaluated outcomes for patients with stage 1b3-3b cervical cancer that had lymph nodes removed prior to planning their chemoradiotherapy. There were 3 groups - patients that had their lymph nodes removed, those that did not and those that had their procedure abandoned so didn't have their lymph nodes removed. We looked at the lymph nodes down the microscope to see if they contained cancer and compared this to their pre-operative imaging. 8 patients had a change to their staging and treatment because they were found to have cancer in the lymph nodes. We found that the keyhole procedure to remove lymph nodes is an acceptable procedure which can guide treatment in women with locally advanced cervical cancer.

AB  - BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that usually affects the lungs, although it can also affect other parts of the body. Vitamin D deficiency and response to treatment have been demonstrated in patients with active TB in several studies, but not in MDR-TB patients, which is a new observation in the present study.ObjectiveTo study the time to initial sputum culture conversion and to associate baseline vitamin D levels and response to treatment in patients with PTB Cat I and MDR-TB.MethodsA total of 897 North Indian participants were recruited and divided into three groups: treatment-na & iuml;ve PTB Cat I, MDR-TB, and healthy controls. Serum biochemistry, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium, was measured in all participants with PTB, Cat I, and MDR-TB.ResultsPTB Cat I patients had high bacillary load grading at baseline compared to 2nd month followed by 6th month of treatment. More severe chest radiographic features, such as cavitation and the presence of bilateral disease at baseline. Mean sputum smear conversion times were 0.95 +/- 0.7 months and culture conversion to negative occurred at a mean time of 0.8 +/- 0.7 in PTB Cat I patients compared to MDR-TB patients on average sputum smear and time of 2.4 +/- 3 months. Significantly lower mean serum 25-hyroxyvitamin D concentration was found in the 6th month than in the 2nd month and baseline in PTB Cat I.ConclusionLow serum vitamin D deficiency was observed in both groups during treatment and is one of the important factors responsible for susceptibility to TB in both groups; however, its significance is uncertain. Patients with continuous positive sputum for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) had a worse prognosis than those with sputum bacteriology conversion. Two months into a treatment regimen, sputum smear conversions may be a useful indicator of an MDR-TB patient's prognosis.

AB  - PurposeOrocervical (OCF) or pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) are one of the disastrous complications of head and neck cancer surgery. Conventional standards of management are predominantly conservative. Though a majority of such patients respond to conservative management, it nevertheless causes significant delay in wound healing. This study explores the role of intraglandular Botulinum toxin injection in shortening the time to fistula healing.MethodsRetrospective case-control study at a tertiary care oncology center in South Asia from January 2021 to December 2023 on all consecutive patients of OCF/PCF. Patients with any history of head and neck radiation were excluded. The case group received intraglandular (parotid+/-submandibular gland) botulinum toxin injection and conservative management and the control group received only conservative management. The time taken for the fistula to heal was the primary outcome.Results31 patients in case and 104 patients were in control group. The mean time from fistula diagnosis till injection was 5.8 +/- 3.1 days and the mean fistula healing time in case group was 18.5 +/- 7.15 days (Range:10-34 days). The mean total dose of botulinum toxin was 59.2 +/- 22.4 MU (Range: 40 to 100 MU). For control group, the mean time taken for the fistula to heal was 26 +/- 15 days (Range:15 to 75 days). The difference was statistically significant (p-0.008, 95% CI: -9.0 to -2.0). Adverse effects attributable to botulinum toxin injection were: pain at the injection site (n = 3) and xerostomia (n = 1). On multivariate analysis, intervention with intraglandular botulinum toxin emerged as an independent variable impacting the time taken for fistula closure.ConclusionThis is the largest study to show the efficacy of intraglandular botulinum toxin injection in reducing the time taken for healing of postoperative salivary fistula with a tolerable adverse effect profile.

AB  - The biotin-conjugated Fe(III) catecholate complex [Fe(BioL)3]3-, Fe(BioL)3 (BioLH2=N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-5-((3aS,4S,6aR)-2-oxohexahydro-1H-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl)pentanamide) is reported as targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) to increase the payload for early-stage imaging of tumours. The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The overall formation constant (log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09 +/- 0.10 and 1.95 +/- 0.09 mM-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively, at 1.41 T and pH 7.35 via second-sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16 +/- 0.15 and 10.0 +/- 0.19 mM-1 s-1, respectively, at 25 degrees C and pH 7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin-binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37 % enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80 % cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89 % of iron has been uptaken into cells.

AB  - The interaction between immune cells brings a consequence either on their role and functioning or the functioning of the other immune cells, modulating the whole mechanistic pathway. The interaction between natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages is one such interaction which is relatively less explored amongst diseased conditions. Their significance comes from their innate nature and secretion of large proportions of cytokines and chemokines which results in influencing adaptive immune responses. Their interplay can lead to several functional outcomes such as NK cell activation/inhibition, increased cytotoxicity and IFN gamma release by NK cells, inhibition of macrophage function, etc. This paper delves into the interaction amongst NK cells and macrophages via different receptor-ligands and cytokines, particularly emphasising microbial infections and tumours. The review has the potential to uncover new insights and approaches that could lead to the development of innovative therapeutic tools and targets.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and severe outcomes such as cirrhosis or cancer. The progression from hepatic steatosis to fibrosis involves significant extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, characterized by increased collagen deposition and cross-linking of ECM proteins, causing increased tissue stiffness and altered MMP expression patterns. Dysregulated MMP expression and extracellular acidosis are key contributors to NAFLD progression. Unlike other MMPs, which may be relevant only at specific disease stages, MMP-9 serves as a universal marker, allowing for monitoring of its expression in relation to disease states and ECM parameters. Understanding dysregulated MMP-9 expression across different NAFLD stages can provide crucial insights into disease progression and serve as both a diagnostic and a prognostic biomarker, identifying potential therapeutic targets. This study introduces a three-dimensional (3D) collagen/alginate-based liver disease model designed to investigate how matrix collagen content, elasticity, and diseased cell conditions influence MMP expression and pH levels in situ using nanoprobes. The platform offered an understanding of the relationships between these factors and their role in NAFLD progression, offering valuable insights into disease progression and potential resolution. To examine how various physicochemical and biological factors, particularly MMP expression and collagen deposition, drive NAFLD progression, three 3D NAFLD models were developed, simulating healthy (HL), steatotic (SL), and fibrotic (FL) liver matrices. Additionally, the role of collagenase treatment in the FL matrix in enhancing MMP expression and potentially mitigating fibrosis was also explored. By employing dual-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes to monitor real-time in situ changes in MMP-9 expression and pH levels, this platform offers a novel approach to understanding the in vitro roles of matrix stiffness, collagen deposition, and diseased cell conditions in NAFLD pathogenesis.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of twelve estimation methods for the exponential logarithmic distribution. The methods investigated include maximum likelihood estimator, moments estimator, modified moments estimator, least squares estimator, weighted least squares estimator, percentiles estimator, maximum product spacings estimator, minimum spacing absolute distance estimator, minimum spacing absolute-log distance estimator, Cram & eacute;r-von Mises estimator, Anderson-Darling estimator, and the right tail Anderson-Darling estimator. Through simulation studies, we assess the efficiency of each estimator based on the mean relative estimate, mean squared error, Dabs, and Dmax criteria, with preference given to estimators exhibiting a mean relative estimate close to one and smaller values of mean squared error, Dabs, and Dmax. Additionally, the practical applicability of these methods is demonstrated through the analysis of three real datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in various scenarios.

AB  - Thirteen children with xeroderma pigmentosum variant C were evaluated using the Dermoscopic Photoaging Assessment Scale (DPAS), the Glogau scale, and the Sun Protection Behavior Scale (SPBS). Most patients exhibited signs of epidermal photoaging, with pigmentary and vascular changes and poor sun protection behavior (mean SPBS score: 18.92 +/- 5.69). The mean DPAS score of 13.15 correlated with the Glogau scale and ocular severity score. Sun protection behavior improved significantly at 6 months after repeated reinforcement of sun protection measures (35 +/- 5.68).

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to compare outcomes following antral preserving (AP) and antral resecting (AR) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in terms of weight loss, gastric emptying time, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), resolution of associated medical problems, and complications.MethodsPatients were prospectively randomized into two groups: the AR group (resection starting 2 cm from the pylorus) and the AP group (resection at 5 cm from the pylorus). Follow-up evaluations included assessments of weight loss using percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and percentage of total weight loss (%TWL), gastric emptying, GERD symptoms, associated medical problem resolution, residual gastric volume, and complications. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, gastric scintigraphy, and residual sleeve volumetry were conducted at 12 months.ResultsOne hundred patients who met inclusion criteria were enrolled, with comparable baseline parameters such as BMI, age, and comorbidities between the groups. Ninety-five patients underwent randomization (49 in AP group and 46 in the AR group), and outcomes were compared. %EWL was higher in the AR group at 12 and 24 months, although this difference was not statistically significant (AP vs. AR: 64.5 +/- 20.6 vs. 72.9 +/- 20.8, p = 0.1, and 66.3 +/- 21.8 vs. 74 +/- 22.2, p = 0.2, respectively). %TWL at 12 months was significantly different between the groups (AP: 28.4 +/- 6.4 vs. AR: 32 +/- 8, p = 0.01), as was %TWL at 24 months (AP: 29.1 +/- 8.4 vs. AR: 33 +/- 8.3, p = 0.01). Gastric emptying increased postoperatively in both groups, with significantly higher residual gastric volume in the AP group. Reflux symptoms decreased in both groups compared to baseline, and associated medical problem resolution and major complication rates were similar between the groups.ConclusionsAR-LSG leads to better weight loss without increasing reflux symptoms compared to AP-LSG. Both procedures showed similar resolution of associated medical problems and complication rates.Trial RegistrationCTRI (CTRI/2018/08/015191).

Autonomic dysregulation and hyperprolactinemia were present in all patients (100%). Sleep disturbances were noted in 4 patients (80%), respiratory support was required for 4 patients (80%), temperature instability in 3 (60%), dysnatremia in 3 (60%), pituitary hormone deficiencies in 3 (60%), behavioral issues in 2 (40%), and neuroectodermal tumor (NET) in 1 patient (20%). Treatment included IVIg for 3 patients with no improvement, home BiPAP support for 1 patient, and unilateral adrenalectomy for a ganglioneuroma in another. Four (80%) patients died during follow-up (mean age at death 5 y); 1 due to sudden cardiorespiratory arrest, and 3 from respiratory tract infections.ConclusionsROHHAD management requires a multimodal approach, addressing pituitary hormone deficiencies, autonomic dysregulation, and screening for hypoventilation and NETs. Emphasis should be on early home respiratory support and monitoring for cardiac rhythm disturbances. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents.

AB  - Dexter energy transfer (DET) of triplet electronic states is used to direct energy in photovoltaics, quench reactive singlet oxygen species in biological systems, and generate them in photodynamic therapy. However, the extent to which repeated DET between aromatic residues can lead to triplet energy migration in proteins has not been investigated. Here, we computationally describe DET rates in microtubules, actin filaments and the intermediate filament, vimentin. We discover instances where interaromatic residue Dexter couplings within individual protein subunits of these polymers are similar those of small molecules used for organic electronics. However, interaromatic residue coupling is mostly weak (<10(-3) eV), limiting triplet energy diffusion lengths to 6.1, 0.5 and 1.0 & Aring; in microtubules, actin filaments and vimentin, respectively. On the other hand, repeated forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between aromatic residues leads to singlet energy diffusion lengths of 12.4 & Aring; for actin filaments and about 8.6 & Aring; for both microtubules and vimentin filaments. Our work shows that singlet energy migration dominates over triplet energy migration in cytoskeletal polymers.

AB  - Meningiomas are the most frequent primary intracranial tumors. Hence, they constitute a major share of diagnostic specimens in neuropathology practice. The 2021 WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors ("CNS5") has introduced the first molecular grading parameters for meningioma with oncogenic variants in the TERT promoter and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B as markers for CNS WHO grade 3. However, after the publication of the new classification volume, clarifications were requested, not only on novel but also on long-standing questions in meningioma grading that were beyond the scope of the WHO "blue book." In addition, more recent research into possible new molecular grading parameters could not yet be implemented in the 2021 classification but constitutes a compelling body of literature. Hence, the consortium to inform molecular and practical approaches to CNS tumor taxonomy-not official WHO (cIMPACT-NOW) Steering Committee convened a working group to provide such clarification and assess the evidence of possible novel molecular criteria. As a result, this cIMPACT-NOW update provides guidance for more standardized morphological evaluation and interpretation, most prominently pertaining to brain invasion, identifies scenarios in which advanced molecular testing is recommended, proposes to assign CNS WHO grade 2 for cases with CNS WHO grade 1 morphology but chromosomal arm 1p deletion in combination with 22q deletion and/or NF2 oncogenic variants, and discusses areas in which the current evidence is not yet sufficient to result in new recommendations.

AB  - ObjectiveRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that, despite available approaches to manage the disease, lacks an efficient treatment and timely diagnosis. Using the most advanced omics technique, metabolomics and proteomics approach, we explored varied metabolites and proteins to identify unique metabolite-protein signatures involved in the disease pathogenesis of RA.MethodsUntargeted metabolomics (n = 20) and proteomics (n = 60) of RA patients' plasma were carried out by HPLC/LC-MS/MS and SWATH, respectively and analyzed by Metaboanalyst. The targets of metabolite retrieved by PharmMapper were matched with SWATH data, and joint pathway analysis was carried out. An in-vitro study of metabolites in TNF-alpha induced SW982 cells was conducted by Western, RT-PCR, scratch, and ROS scavenging assay. The effect of GUDCA was also evaluated in the CIA rat model.ResultsA Total of 82 metabolites and 231 differential proteins were revealed. Porphyrin and chlorophyll pathway and its metabolite Glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) was found to be significantly altered. In vitro analysis has shown that GUDCA reduces inflammation thus offering protection against ROS production and cell proliferation. PharmMapper analysis revealed that GUDCA was significantly linked with identified SWATH proteins insulin like growth factor-1(IGF1), and Transthyretin (TTR) and it upregulates the expression of IGF1 and downregulates the expression of TTR in both in vitro and in vivo models.ConclusionGUDCA was found to possess antioxidative, antiproliferative properties and an effective anti-inflammatory property at a low dosage. It may be considered as a potential therapeutic option for reducing the inflammatory parameters associated with RA.

AB  - Sustainable plant disease management has long been a major issue in agriculture since the excessive reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides exacerbates chemical resistance, presenting environmental and health hazards. Taking cues from nature's intricate defense mechanisms, scientists are exploiting bioactive agents involved in plant-pathogen/pest interactions to develop novel strategies to combat diseases. Embracing biomolecules in agriculture offers an ecofriendly alternative to chemical pesticides. However, traditional delivery methods for biomolecules often suffer from low utilization rates and low field stability, diminishing the overall effectiveness of active compounds. The advent of nanotechnology has facilitated the design of novel delivery systems for biomolecular cargos, further enhancing their capacity to adhere to plant surfaces and make disease control strategies effective. Tailored depending upon the extent of infection and type of plant species, innovative nanoparticle strategies maximize the effectiveness of delivery by modifying the size, surface characteristics, and adhesion capacity of the particles to suit particular requirements. This review examines how the various biological factors involved in innate plant defenses can be exploited, as well as the potential of various nanocarriers in biomolecule delivery for plant disease management.

AB  - Purpose Incidentally detected gallbladder cancer (IGBC) constitutes a significant fraction of the gallbladder cancer burden. We investigated various parameters for association with increased risk of non-regional lymph nodal or distant metastases in IGBC. The oncologist may thus be guided when to advise F-18-FDG PET-CT to exclude advanced disease before planning completion surgeries. Methods Data from 50 patients (36 females, 14 males) with IGBC who underwent F-18-FDG PET-CT scans were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of distant metastases. Results Distant metastatic disease was present in 29/50 (58%) patients on F-18-FDG PET-CT. 6/50 patients had only locoregional residual disease while 15/50 patients had no abnormal lesion. On univariate analysis, female gender (P = 0.012), pT2a or above extent (P = 0.003), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.023), positive cystic duct margin (P = 0.022), local residual disease on CECT (P = 0.006) and regional lymph nodes on CECT (P = 0.022) were associated with distant metastases. On multivariate analysis, pT2a or above extent (P = 0.029, odds ratio = 10.9), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.016, odds ratio = 19.5), local residual disease (P = 0.006, odds ratio = 60.5) and regional nodes on CECT (P = 0.02, odds ratio = 16.8) remained independent predictors of metastatic disease. In 12/50 (24%) patients, PET-CT detected additional lesions over CECT leading to a change of management in 10/50 (20%) patients. Conclusion F-18-FDG PET-CT may be advised to exclude distant metastases in IGBC patients with any of the four predictive features, including T-stage pT2a or above, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and local residual or regional lymph nodal disease on CECT.

AB  - ObjectivesComprehensive packages for training healthcare professionals who care for premature newborns are scarce. AIIMS WHO CC, New Delhi, partnered with India Association of Neonatal Nurses (IANN) and National Neonatology Forum (NNF) and 35 national leaders in the field of newborn care to develop a multimodal educational package for preterm infants.MethodsFindings from evaluation of four representative special newborn care units in the state of Madhya Pradesh informed the content of the package. Each of the ten modules developed had pre-defined lesson plan with learning objectives, self-reading text, short videos, webinars, posters and job aids, and knowledge check. The entire package was converted into a printed format, loaded onto a self-directed, web-based E-learning platform, and made available as a smart phone app. Six 3-day back-to-back dissemination workshops were held for 208 participants, who completed designated E-modules and generated a completion certificate before attending the face-to-face workshop. A five-point Likert's scale and open-ended comments were used to assess users' satisfaction with the modules, and the quality and readability of materials.ResultsOf the total, 188/208 (90%) attendees provided dissemination workshop feedback. When asked to rate their proficiency, 34% rated themselves as 'proficient or expert' before the workshop while 92% afterwards. Nearly 80% of participants felt that the quality of the information, content organization, and case scenarios were excellent to exceptional.ConclusionsThe "preterm baby package" is a comprehensive, acceptable, need-based educational package for training staff who manage small and sick newborns with local facilitators for Indian context. There is a need of implementation studies evaluating its efficacy in improving newborn outcomes.

TI  - Prevalence and Pattern of Traumatic Dental Injuries in Children and Adolescents With Severe to Profound Hearing Impairment: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - DENTAL TRAUMATOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - RISK
AB  - Background/Aim Traumatic Dental Injuries (TDIs) are an emerging public health problem and a realm of research for oral health enthusiasts. Certain populations can be more vulnerable to injuries such as those with a sensory deficit. Nevertheless, literature is scarce, especially for those with hearing impairment. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and patterns of TDI in children and adolescents with severe-to profound hearing impairments and children without hearing impairments. Material and Methods Three hundred and ninety participants (195 severe to profound hearing impaired and 195 age and sex-matched controls) between 4 and 18 years were recruited from a tertiary care setting. A single calibrated examiner evaluated TDI for both groups. Among those with TDI, a vestibular function test (VFT) was also performed to assess postural balance. A single examiner from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology evaluated the VFT results. Results The overall prevalence of TDI was found to be 12.82% among the severe to profound hearing-impaired individuals, and 11.79% in controls. The majority of participants were aged between 7 and 13 years, in the mixed dentition stage, and were males. Among the cases, the majority had profound hearing loss (>= 91 dB HL) and bilateral ear involvement. The most common type of TDI was uncomplicated crown fractures. Falls were identified as the most common cause of TDI in both groups. Vestibular dysfunction and loss of postural control were identified in 12 out of 14 patients tested with VFT. A significant association was found between TDI and the dentition type, that is, primary dentition was more affected among the severe to profound hearing impaired as compared to controls (p < 0.05). Conclusion There was no significant association between the severity of hearing impairment and the prevalence of dental trauma in children and adolescents with severe to profound hearing impairment. However, hearing-impaired individuals were susceptible to trauma at an early age compared to their healthy counterparts.

TI  - Darolutamide in Combination With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer From the Phase III ARANOTE Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB  - PURPOSE For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), delaying progression to castration-resistant disease is important not only for overall survival (OS) but also for patients' quality of life. Darolutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel improved OS versus ADT and docetaxel in patients with mHSPC. The ARANOTE trial evaluated darolutamide and ADT without chemotherapy in patients with mHSPC. METHODS In this global phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, with concomitant ADT. The primary end point was radiological progression-free survival (rPFS). RESULTS From March 2021 to August 2022, 669 patients were randomly assigned (darolutamide n = 446; placebo n = 223). At the primary cutoff date (June 7, 2024), darolutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS, reducing the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71]; P < .0001), with consistent benefits across subgroups, including high- and low-volume disease. OS results were suggestive of benefit with darolutamide versus placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12]), and clinical benefits were seen across all other secondary end points, including delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.51]) and time to pain progression (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96]). Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Notably, the incidence of fatigue was lower in patients receiving darolutamide (5.6%) versus those receiving placebo (8.1%), and fewer patients receiving darolutamide (6.1%) versus placebo (9.0%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSION These results confirm the efficacy and tolerability of darolutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC, demonstrating clinically and statistically significant improvement in rPFS and a favorable safety profile consistent with prior phase III darolutamide trials.

AB  - Background Malnutrition among children remains a critical public health challenge in India. WHO's IYCF model recommends that children should feed on five out of eight food categories daily. The objective of the study is to assess dietary diversity and associated risk factors among children, focusing on complex interplay of socio-economic and demographic factors. Methods The study utilized nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted in 2019-2021, focusing on a sample of 62,553 children aged 6-24 months. Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) was assessed using children received foods from >= 5 food group out of eight specified food groups over the 24 h preceding the survey. Logistic regression employed to examine the association between DD and its predictors (p value < 0.05). Results Overall, 52% of the children were male, while the remaining 48% were female. Only 23.3% of the children across India achieved MDD. Mother's education was positively associated with dietary diversity (OR:1.15; 95% CI:0.92-1.4). Factors significantly associated with dietary diversity were children aged 19-23 months (OR:4.03; CI:3.46-4.69), working mothers (OR:1.30; 95% CI:1.14-1.5) and children belonged to middle (OR:1.22; CI:1.05-1.43) and rich socio-economic status (OR:1.48; CI:1.26-1.8) as compared to their counterparts. Additionally, no difference found in dietary diversity among male and female children (OR:1.01; CI:0.9-1.11) and urban and rural areas (OR:101; CI:0.87-1.17). Those children belonged to Northeast region had around 70% higher dietary diversity as compared to Central region. Conclusion This study highlights a concerning low prevalence of dietary diversity among young children in India. Interventions and policies should target on implementing comprehensive nutrition education programs for caregivers, coupled with targeted financial support and community engagement.

AB  - Background Nuclear import, dependent on the transporter importin alpha (IMP alpha), is a drug target for apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Indeed, a panel of small molecule inhibit interactions between IMP alpha and nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in vitro and the growth of rapidly dividing stages (P. falciparum blood stages and T. gondii tachyzoites) in culture.Objectives As new drugs targeting multiple life cycle stages of both parasites are required, the panel of IMP alpha inhibitors was tested for their ability to inhibit nuclear transport in the rapidly dividing stages and the maturation of differentiated stages (P. falciparum gametocytes and T. gondii bradyzoites).Methods Using biophysical assays, Bay 11-7082, a Bay 11-7085 structural analogue, was tested for inhibition of IMP alpha:NLS interactions. The effect of the panel of inhibitors on the nuclear localization of reporter proteins was analysed in both parasites using transfections and microscopy. Also, using microscopy, the effect of inhibitors on differentiated stages of both parasites was tested.Results Bay 11-7085 can inhibit nuclear transport in tachyzoites, while GW5074 and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE) can inhibit nuclear transport in the blood stages. Interestingly, CAPE can strongly inhibit gametocyte maturation, and Bay 11-7082 and Bay 11-7085 weakly inhibit bradyzoite differentiation.Conclusions As differentiation of gametocytes and bradyzoites is dependent on the activation of gene expression triggered by the nuclear translocation of transcription factors, our work provides a 'proof of concept' that targeting nuclear import is a viable strategy for the development of therapeutics against multiple stages of apicomplexan parasites, some of which are recalcitrant to existing drugs.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily driven by the protein Alpha Synuclein (A-Syn) accumulation. Synphilin-1 protein, encoded by the SNCAIP gene, which co-localizes with A-Syn is a known risk factor for PD. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is a cluster of retinal degenerative disorders, and Cyclic Nucleotide Gated channel subunit Alpha 1 (CNGA1) is one of the initial genes associated with RP. Patients with PD can have various kinds of visual dysfunction as a non-motor manifestation, but to date, CNGA1 mutation and RP as a PD associated visual symptom has not been reported. We report a mutation in the SNCAIP gene in a PD patient, not reported earlier, and its co-occurrence with RP-associated CNGA1 gene mutation. Method: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the patient DNA sample and in-silico protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis performed to find out proteins interacting with SNCAIP relevant concerning reported mutation of SNCAIP and further, CNGA1 interaction with SNCAIP. Result: We are reporting, a missense mutation (p.Thr64Ser) at the SNCAIP gene, co-occurring with a missense variation (p.Gly509Arg) in the CNGA1 gene. In silico PPI analysis suggests SIAH1 as an important protein affected by SNCAIP mutation. LGALS4 and SNCA (gene encoding A-Syn) are common interactors between SNCAIP and CNGA1. Conclusion: The current study has determined the co-occurrence of RP and PD, whole exome sequencing ascertains the mutations in SNCAIP and CNGA1 genes, which could be the cause of PD and RP co-occurrence.

AB  - Thyroid cancer (TC) being the common endocrine malignancy is glooming steadily due to its poor prognosis. The treatment strategies of surgery, radiotherapy, and conventional chemotherapy are providing unsatisfactory output. However, combination therapy can negotiate the worse prognosis to the better, where chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy with surgery, or dual chemotherapeutic drugs are being glorified. Chemotherapy includes the use of doxorubicin or taxanes generally with platinum-based drugs viz. cisplatin or carboplatin that are administered alone or along with multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors viz. Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Vandetanib, Pyrazolo-pyrimidine compounds, etc., single target tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Dabrafenib plus Trametinib and Vemurafenib against BRAF, Gefitinib against EGFR, Everolimus against mTOR, vascular disruptors like Fosbretabulin, and immunotherapy with viz. Spartalizumab and Pembrolizumab, are anti-PD-1/PD-L1 molecules. Hence, several trials are currently evaluating the possible beneficial role of combinatorial therapy in TC. Since TC is the outcome of multiple genetic alterations, it necessitates targeting the multiple factors in a single shot. These combination strategies for systemically delivering therapeutic drugs seem feasible only with the help of theranostic. To date, nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) have devoted themselves to diagnosis, bioimaging, imaging-assisted surgery, and therapy with high success rates. The ease of handling hybrid technologies is also selectively admirable. However, in this review, we have summarized the sequential progression of chemotherapeutic drugs to NDDS designed for Personalized Medicine (PM) against TC. Personalized medicine is an ever-growing field that will be explored in future discoveries in biomedicine, particularly cancer theranostics. Hence, our review presents a closer view of NDDS as a personalized treatment for TC. We have also discussed the primary challenges facing NDDS in meeting excellence in PM.

AB  - Background: Patients with primary brain tumors navigate a distinct illness trajectory, characterized by an uncertain prognosis, a rapid decline in physical functioning, and a significant deterioration in the quality of life. These unique challenges underscore the importance of our research in understanding and addressing the needs of these patients. Methods: The EORTC QLQ C30 & EORTC BN 20 questionnaires assessed the quality of life and symptom burden in patients with primary brain tumors. The scores were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Results: 100 patients - 61 males and 39 females-were included with radiological or histopathological diagnoses of primary brain tumours. Seizures (38%) was the most common presenting symptom, followed by headache (18%), loss of consciousness (13%), focal neurological deficit (9%), and blurring of vision (8%). The mean quality of life at baseline was 78.29, with a standard deviation of 9.67 on a scale of 0 to 100, and the brain tumor-specific symptom burden score was 46.9, with a standard deviation of 17.95 on a scale of 0 to 100. There was a significant difference in the global health status score between the first and third visits at 3 months (P value = .03). Conclusion: Despite the aggressive and often incurable nature of primary brain tumors, there is hope in the form of palliative care. By addressing unmet symptoms, uncertainties about the future, and social functioning, palliative care can significantly improve the quality of life of these patients.

AB  - BackgroundThe objective of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of care among women diagnosed with vulvar malignancy at a tertiary care teaching institute. Additionally, the study aimed to analyse the implications of revised FIGO staging system on stage shift and patient outcomes.MethodsA retrospective observational study was conducted, wherein hospital records of biopsy-proven cases of vulvar cancers managed over a period of 10 years were comprehensively reviewed. The assignment of FIGO staging was performed utilizing both 2009 and 2021 FIGO staging systems for comparative analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 17. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences assessed using the log-rank test. Additionally, multivariable analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard model.ResultsA total of 82 cases meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Management patterns varied widely, with the majority undergoing surgery (73.2%), followed by definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (10.9%), neoadjuvant radiotherapy and subsequent surgery (4.9%), and palliative care (10.9%). Post-operative radiotherapy was administered in 31.7% of cases. The disease-specific recurrence rate was found to be 32.9%, and the mortality rate was 30.5%. The median Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was 17 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-36 months), while the Overall Survival (OS) was 27 months (IQR: 9-52 months). Upon application of the 2021 staging system, a stage shift was observed in 18% of cases of advanced vulvar cancer. The 3-year DFS and OS were reduced for stage IIIA and stage IVA, while showing improvement for stage IIIB.ConclusionsThe revised FIGO 2021 staging system offers enhanced simplicity in its application within clinical practice and demonstrates improved correlation with prognosis. Approximately 18% cases experienced restaging under the updated system.Trial registration numberNot applicable.

AB  - Background/Aim The evidence related to the superiority of the recommended treatment protocols for necrotic immature permanent teeth is unclear. We aimed to compare the clinical, radiographic, and overall success rates of apexification and regenerative endodontic treatment (RET), assess the methodological quality, and assess the strength of evidence for outcomes. Methods A search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The titles, abstracts and full texts of systematic reviews (SRs) comparing RET and apexification were screened. The quality and strength of evidence were analyzed via AMSTAR-2, ROBIS, and modified Kohler's criteria. Results Twelve SRs were included, with nine having meta-analytic outcomes. The quality of only one study was high, and the risk of bias was low in two studies. Comparable success and survival rates for RET and apexification, with no superiority of any treatment, were reported. RET was superior in stimulating root thickness and lengthening. Weak evidence was noted for a higher clinical and radiographic success rate of the apical plug technique and for root lengthening and an increase in root thickness in RET. Conclusion RET and apexification exhibited comparable success rates of > 85% across all domains. Most comparisons did not reveal significant differences in clinical, radiographic, or overall success. However, the quality of evidence was weak (class IV) for both outcomes, and the majority of systematic reviews exhibited low or critically low quality and high risk of bias.

AB  - Purpose To assess diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (pCT) based biomarkers in differentiating clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC. Materials and method This retrospective study comprised 95 patients with RCCs (70 ccRCCs and 25 non-ccRCCs) who had perfusion CT (pCT) before surgery between January 2017 and December 2022. Two readers independently recorded PCT parameters [blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP)] by drawing a circular ROI on the tumor. The open-source program "Labelme" was used to create a polygonal bounding box to outline tumor borders. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine interreader agreement. The pCT model was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis with the STATA 18 program to determine the importance of each of these characteristics in predicting the type of tumor. Results Clear cell RCC had significantly greater MIP and lower TTP values than non-clear cell RCC (p < 0.05). RCCs showed considerably higher TTP, MTT, and lower MIP values than the normal renal cortex (p < 0.05). At a threshold of 129 HU, MIP had an AUC of 0.78, sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 70%, respectively, according to ROC analysis. Conclusions pCT has a high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing between ccRCC and non-ccRCC tumors;Clinical relevance: A non-invasive, accurate, reliable, and reproducible imaging biomarker for RCC subtype prediction is possible on pCT, which may be significant for evaluating the response to antiangiogenic therapy.

AB  - Injectable hydrogels are a sub-type of hydrogels which can be delivered into the host in a minimally invasive manner. They can act as carriers to encapsulate and deliver cells, drugs or active biomolecules across several disease conditions. Polymers, either synthetic or natural, or even a combination of the two, can be used to create injectable hydrogels. Clinically approved injectable hydrogels are being used as dressings for burn wounds, bone and cartilage reconstruction. Injectable hydrogels have recently gained tremendous attention for their delivery into the liver in pre-clinical models. However, their efficacy in clinical studies remains yet to be established. In this article, we describe principles for the design of these injectable hydrogels, delivery strategies and their potential applications in facilitating liver regeneration and ameliorating injury. We also discuss the several constraints related to translation of these hydrogels into clinical settings for liver diseases and deliberate some potential solutions to combat these challenges.

AB  - NR1D1::MAML1/L2 fusion-positive sarcomas constitute an emerging subtype of undifferentiated sarcomas, histopathologically composed of epithelioid and spindle cells. We describe two NR1D1exon6::MAML2exon2 fusion-positive sarcomas occurring in the occipital region of a 53-year-old female patient and the left shoulder of a 25-year-old male patient. Histopathologically, the former tumor comprised spindle and polygonal-shaped/epithelioid cells, while the latter comprised epithelioid cells. Immunohistochemically, the cells of the first tumor were positive for keratin cocktail (AE1/AE3), EMA, and p40. The other tumor lacked any epithelial marker immunoexpression and showed SATB2 positivity. Both the tumors were SMARCB1 proficient. While the former tumor was initially diagnosed as a sarcomatoid carcinoma, the latter was diagnosed as an undifferentiated sarcoma.Both patients underwent surgical resection as the primary treatment. One patient received adjuvant radiotherapy, whereas the other received ifosfamide and doxorubicin-based therapy. However, both the patients developed progressive disease, with one developing lung metastasis during relapse. There was a suboptimal response to chemotherapy in both patients.This study highlights the clinicopathological features of two rare and emerging sarcomas. It further emphasizes the value of high-throughput molecular testing, such as next-generation sequencing in the undifferentiated epithelioid, and spindle-cell sarcomas to identify the prognostic subtypes and differentiate these neoplasms from their histopathological mimics.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to describe the indications, complications, yield, and safety of amniocentesis beyond 24 weeks for prenatal diagnostic procedures along with the associated maternal and fetal outcomes.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 pregnant women (with 61 fetuses) who underwent amniocentesis at or beyond 24 weeks from March 2021 to June 2023 at a tertiary care referral center. Data was collected from medical records and individual patient followups. Descriptive data was collected on patient demographics, amniocentesis indications, and the test results. The other outcomes analyzed were the procedure-related complications and pregnancy outcomes.Results The mean gestational age at time of the procedure was 254/7 (241/7-331/7). The most common indication for late amniocentesis was abnormal sonographic findings (44/61, 72.13 %), with structural anomalies being the commonest (21/61, 34.44 %). There were no complications related to the procedure. Of the 60 women, 88.3 % (53/60) continued their pregnancies, while 11.66 % (7/60) opted for termination of pregnancy, and two patients had intrauterine fetal demise (2/61, 3.27 %). Genetic testing revealed abnormalities in 6.55 % (4/61) of cases. Of the 51 pregnancies, 39 delivered vaginally (76.47 %; 39/51) and 12 (23.52 %; 12/51) required caesarean sections. There were five neonatal and infant deaths due to heart defects (2), metabolic syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and non-immune hydrops, respectively.Conclusions Amniocentesis, done at a later gestation, is a safe and an effective tool for prenatal diagnosis and provides an opportunity to make a genetic diagnosis and further counseling.

AB  - Tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-2 (Tyrp2) play a pivotal role in melanin production within melanocytes. Both share a high degree of structural and sequence similarity, with a Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) of 0.75 & Aring; and 62% sequence similarity, including 43% sequence identity. Despite these similarities, differences in the allosteric sites, particularly the residues that constitute these sites, contribute to distinct regulatory mechanisms. This study elucidates the contrasting allosteric modulation of tyrosinase and Tyrp2 by two flavonoids: (a) luteolin and (b) apigenin, respectively. Luteolin demonstrated its allosteric inhibitory property against tyrosinase by disturbing the spatial arrangement of histidine residues critical for copper coordination, essential for enzymatic activity. Conversely, apigenin serves as an allosteric activator for Tyrp2, enhancing structural stability and maintaining the active site conformation. Despite the structural resemblance between luteolin and apigenin, differentiated by a single hydroxyl group, their impact on melanin synthesis diverges - luteolin inhibits, whereas apigenin stimulates the process. Both showed high binding affinity at the allosteric site of tyrosinase and Tyrp2. Luteolin significantly alters the spatial arrangement of key histidine residues (HIS180, HIS202 and HIS211), forming coordination bonds in tyrosinase, affecting copper coordination and coordination with the peroxide (O(2)2(-)) ion. However, apigenin did not remain bound to tyrosinase for an extended period, ruling out its role as an allosteric modulator. In contrast, apigenin stayed at the allosteric site of the Tyrp2 protein and showed a positive allosteric regulator role. The findings offer a mechanistic view of melanin synthesis regulation, demonstrating the potential of subtle structural variations in modulators to selectively influence enzyme activity in related biosynthetic pathways. This underscores the intricate control within melanogenic systems and the possibility of targeting these pathways for therapeutic and cosmetic applications.

AB  - BackgroundDirect laryngoscopy and biopsy have been the standard of care for biopsy of lesions arising from the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT). The requirement of general anesthesia is often a prerequisite. Procedures performed under the laryngeal block and local anesthesia are not viewed as appropriate from the point of view of patient comfort. Office-based flexible guided biopsy offers a less invasive alternative for obtaining biopsies from UADT.ObjectiveTo evaluate the yield, accuracy, feasibility, and safety of office-based flexible fiber-optic endoscope-directed biopsy (FEB) for laryngeal & pharyngeal lesions.MethodsSetting- Tertiary care referral center.Retrospective cohort of FEB procedures undertaken in the period from June-December 2022.ResultsThe study sample included 181 consecutive patients (median age 59 years) with lesions in supraglottis-25.4%, glottis-20.4%, nasopharynx-6%, oropharynx (base tongue/vallecula)-24.8%, and hypopharynx(pyriform fossa)-23.2%. The median time from outpatient visit to FEB was 1.9 days (1-4 days).Malignancy was confirmed in 166/181 patients, with 8 pre-malignant and 7 benign lesions. FEB confirmed the appropriate diagnosis in 159/181 (88.1%), and a repeat FEB in the 22 non-diagnostic situations yielded a diagnosis in another 8 (92.8% overall). The remaining 14 patients were appropriately diagnosed by a subsequent operating room endoscopy. The rate of conversion to direct laryngoscopy biopsy was approximately 7.73%. FEB demonstrated sensitivity (86.8%), specificity (100%), Positive Predictive Value (100%), Negative Predictive Value (23.3%), and overall Accuracy (87.29%).Univariate analysis indicated poor diagnostic yield for nasopharynx subsite (OR - 0.15; p = 0.003) and post-radiation/chemoradiation cases(OR - 7.04; p = 0.05). Multivariate analysis of the impact of patient characteristics, lesion subsite/morphology, and prior tracheostomy did not reveal a statistically significant association with histological yield. Mean biopsy time was 8 min with minor complications (pain/ minor bleeding) in 29/203 FEB procedures (14.28%), and major complications in 12(5.9%) (significant bleeding-2, airway compromise-9; death-1).ResultsThe study sample included 181 consecutive patients (median age 59 years) with lesions in supraglottis-25.4%, glottis-20.4%, nasopharynx-6%, oropharynx (base tongue/vallecula)-24.8%, and hypopharynx(pyriform fossa)-23.2%.

AB  - Contemporary research evidence has corroborated a gradual loss of central cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This progressive deterioration leads to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, culminating in the brain cell's death in the disease. The approved drugs for AD treatment can only offer relief from symptoms without addressing the underlying pathological hallmarks of the disease. To address the limitations associated with rivastigmine (RIV), a marketed drug for AD, a series of tryptamine derivatives was designed, synthesized, and evaluated in various in-vitro and in-vivo AD models. Enzyme inhibition studies identified compounds 6d and 6e as the lead molecules with potent inhibitors against AChE (6d, IC50: 0.99 f 0.009 nM and 6e IC50: 7.97 f 0.016 nM and BChE (6d, IC50: 27.79 f 0.21 nM and 6e , IC50: 0.79 f 0.005 nM), compared to the marketed drug Riv (AChE, IC50: 6630 f 0.76 nM, BChE IC50 = 91 f 0.40 nM). The molecular docking and dynamics studies corroborated the enzyme inhibition studies. The PAMPA assay strongly suggested the BBB crossing ability of the lead molecules. Further, 6d and 6e demonstrated the capability to counteract oxidative stress and A beta 1-42 in various in-vitro studies. Compound 6e exhibited remarkable radical scavenging activity in the DPPH assay (IC50: 22.91 f 1.73 mu M) compared to rivastigmine (% radical scavenging activity: 3.71 f 0.09 at 200 mu M). Interestingly, 6d and 6e exhibited promising activity in the AD Drosophila model by protecting eye phenotypes from degeneration induced by A beta 1-42 toxicity and reduced mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress in this model. Furthermore, upon oral administration, 6d and 6e could reverse scopolamine- induced amnesia by improving spatial and cognitive memory in mice at 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg compared to rivastigmine at 3 mg/kg and were found to have potent ex-vivo anti-ChEs properties, which are correlated with the observed pro-cognitive effects in the Morris Water Maze, likely mediated through the inhibition of both cholinesterases. The expression of various neuroprotection markers, such as BDNF and TRKB, was significantly overexpressed compared to the disease control group.

AB  - Background Rapid diagnosis of stroke and its subtypes is critical in early stages. We aimed to discover and validate blood-based protein biomarkers to differentiate ischemic stroke (IS) from intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) using high-throughput proteomics. Methods We collected serum samples within 24 h from acute stroke (IS & ICH) and mimics patients. In the discovery phase, SWATH-MS proteomics identified differentially expressed proteins, which were validated using targeted proteomics in the validation phase. We conducted interaction network and pathway analyses using Cytoscape 3.10.0. We determined cut-off points using the Youden Index. We developed three prediction models using multivariable logistic regression analyses. We assessed the model performance using statistical tests. Results We included 20 IS and 20 ICH in the discovery phase and 150 IS, 150 ICH, and six stroke mimics in the validation phase. We quantified 375 proteins using SWATH-MS. Between IS and ICH, we discovered 20 differentially expressed proteins. In the validation phase, the combined prediction model including three biomarkers: GFAP (aOR 0.04; 95%CI .02-.11), MMP-9 (aOR .09; .03-.28), APO-C1 (aOR 5.76; 2.66-12.47) and clinical variables independently differentiated IS from ICH (accuracy: 92%, negative predictive value: 94%). Adding biomarkers to clinical variables improved discrimination by 26% (p < .001). Additionally, nine biomarkers differentiated IS from ICH within 6 h, while three biomarkers differentiated IS from mimics. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that GFAP, MMP-9 and APO-C1 biomarkers independently differentiated IS from ICH within 24 h and significantly improved the discrimination ability of prediction models. Temporal profiling of these biomarkers in the acute phase of stroke is warranted.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Working memory (WM) impairment is a common and progressive abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which ultimately leads to dementia. Individuals with PD exhibit altered electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns while engaging in tasks that require WM. The study examined the EEG patterns associated with WM maintenance in PD patients. Methods:The study consisted of two groups of PD patients with a sign of dementia (PDD) who had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score <= 24, PD patients with no sign of dementia (PDND) with an MMSE score >24, and a group of healthy individuals serving as controls (CON). We obtained EEG during a word memorization task using a 128-channel system. The spectral power of the EEG was computed using the fast Fourier transformation algorithm. Results:Compared to both PDND and CON groups, PDD group exhibited higher power in the delta and beta frequency bands. Conversely, there was a notable decrease in power in the gamma band in both the PDD and PDND groups compared to the CON group. In addition, the PDD group exhibited higher power in the gamma band compared to the PDND group. Power in the alpha (LA1, LA2, and UA) and theta bands was greater in PDND and PDD compared to CON, but was similar between PDND and PDD groups. Conclusion:While performing WM tasks, PDD exhibits increased delta and beta power. These findings can be used as a quantitative biomarker to evaluate the severity of initial WM impairments, which could potentially develop into dementia in the future.

AB  - A substantial share of patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) fail to achieve control of CVD risk factors, but clinicians lack a structured approach to identify these patients. We applied machine learning to longitudinal data from two completed randomized controlled trials among 1502 individuals with diabetes in urban India and Pakistan. Using commonly available clinical data, we predict each individual's risk of failing to achieve CVD risk factor control goals or meaningful improvements in risk factors at one year after baseline. When classifying those in the top quartile of predicted risk scores as at risk of failing to achieve goals or meaningful improvements, the precision for not achieving goals was 73% for HbA1c, 30% for SBP, and 24% for LDL, and for not achieving meaningful improvements 88% for HbA1c, 87% for SBP, and 85% for LDL. Such models could be integrated into routine care and enable efficient and targeted delivery of health resources in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - Introduction Although closely associated with obesity, non-obese patients are also at significant risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Burden of OSA is grossly underestimated in non-obese Asian population. Most risk scores incorporate body mass index (BMI). This study tried to develop BMI-independent score to predict high-risk OSA in Indian population. Methods This retrospective observational study analyzed anthropo-demographic, clinical and polysomnography data of 1898 patients. Coefficients of variables from multivariate regression analysis were used to create a BMI-independent score. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis used to determine optimal cut-off; performance reported using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios. Results Mean age was 45.9 years; 73.0% were males. Most patients had severe OSA (54.7%) and high-risk Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (62.0%). Mean ESS value was higher for high-risk compared to mild OSA group (11.8 +/- 5.6 vs. 9.2 +/- 5.1, p < 0.001). Area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) to predict high-risk OSA by ESS and MBQ was 0.59 and 0.57 respectively. Sub scapular skin fold thickness (SSFT), waist-hip ratio (WHR), Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) and triceps skin fold thickness (TSFT) were significantly associated with high risk OSA and included in SWET score. SWET score >= 37.2 had 68.2% sensitivity and 81.8% positive predictive value to predict moderate or severe OSA with AUROC of 0.62. Conclusions The novel SWET score shows significant promise to predict risk of OSA, independent of BMI. The performance exceeded that of traditional tools like ESS and MBQ in our study population. However, it requires further validation in large prospective cohorts.

AB  - Background: Malignant transformation of neurofibromas into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) is a rare but aggressive phenomenon, particularly in the head and neck region, and is associated with a poor prognosis. The primary treatment modality is surgical excision, often followed by radiotherapy. This is a case report of MPNST in the neck, with long-term follow-up. Case Presentation: A 26-year-old woman presented with a history of multiple progressively enlarging neck swellings for 8 years. The swellings were associated with mild pain and occasional bleeding. The patient had undergone 3 prior surgical excisions, with a fourth recurrence leading to complete excision and split-thickness skin grafting due to extensive raw surface area. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of MPNST. The patient subsequently received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy due to the aggressive nature of the pathology. Results: The patient has been under regular follow-up for 36 months, with no evidence of local, regional, or distant metastasis. Conclusion: Malignant transformation of neurofibromas is a rare entity, particularly in the head and neck. Early surgical intervention followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy provides effective long-term control of the disease and improved survival.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoV), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, were not considered dangerous pathogens until the outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and more recently, COVID-19. The coronaviruses causing these respective diseases/syndromes, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV2, share high sequence and structural similarities. COVID-19 continues to have a global impact on human health and the economy. Human-to-human transmission is at the center of COVID-19's ability to stall the entire world and force lockdowns across the globe. The corona viruses' positive sense RNA genome is similar to 30 kb long and encodes non-structural (ORF1ab) and structural (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, and Nucleo-capsid) proteins. The main viral protease (NSP5) is a Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) that cleaves on the carboxy side of the glutamine (Q) of the polypeptide sequence motif x-(L/F/M)-Q-(G/A/S)-x. 3CL(PRO) is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is critical in the replication and viral life cycle. Therefore, 3CL(PRO) is considered a promising drug target. We have recently reported three natural compounds, flavonoid derivatives, to target the cysteine 145 of the catalytic dyad covalently. Here, we have screened for small molecules with pan coronavirus activity to target 3CL(pro). Our rigid body docking studies have identified 30 small molecules with comparable binding affinities to all the beta coronaviruses. Of these, five molecules have showed the possibility of covalently attacking the C145 of the catalytic dyad. MD simulations have revealed compounds 22 and 23 to be the most ideal lead compounds. Interestingly, one of the compounds, 22, identified in the current study has already shown to be an ideal lead compound against SARS-CoV2 3CL(PRO).

AB  - Background India witnessed three COVID-19 pandemic waves, each with various degrees of severity and clinical signs. The coronavirus strain and immunization status have a significant impact on the severity of COVID-19 infections. The current study intends to evaluate and compare the symptoms, severity, and breakthrough infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals over the three waves of the pandemic.Methods This was a retrospective survey study. A Google based questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status, re-infections, associated symptoms, severity, and vaccination status over three waves, post-COVID-19 sequelae, and willingness to receive a COVID-19 booster dose in the Indian population. The replies of 3,404 Indian participants were analysed using STATA 11.Results Each wave showed a decrease in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. However, fever and loss of smell/taste were identified as the most common symptoms in each wave. Clinical symptoms such as fever, weariness, and shortness of breath were shown to be considerably higher in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals. The number of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections increased between the second and third waves. Approximately 36.5% of people with protracted COVID-19 had previously received immunization after recovering from a natural COVID-19 illness. Overall, 34.8% of individuals were hesitant to take the COVID-19 booster dose.Conclusion Increased symptoms in vaccinated individuals during the second wave, emphasizing the potential role of antibody-dependent augmentation. A considerable fraction (36.5%) of those with protracted COVID-19 infections had previously received vaccination after contracting the virus naturally. The fact that vaccine received after COVID-19 infection has been shown to be a risk factor for long-term COVID-19 emphasizes the need for vigilance in this specific subgroup.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive disorder caused due to the persistence of mutant measles virus in the brain. Treatment strategies for SSPE remain largely undefined, and there exists no information on how neurologists are currently managing SSPE. Methods: A survey-based study was conducted among Indian neurologists managing pediatric and adult patients with SSPE. A questionnaire-based survey was circulated by email regarding respondent demographics, preference for disease-modifying strategies, and symptomatic therapy. Results: Survey response was obtained from 298 neurologists (responder rate 9.5%) and eventually analyzed from 266 respondents who managed SSPE in routine practice. This included 222 (83.5%) adult and 44 (16.5%) pediatric neurologists from 21 states of India. Ninety-five respondents (35.7%) indicated that they always advised Isoprinosine (inosine pranobex) to their patients. Regarding interferon therapy, 121 (45.5%) reported never advising it, whereas 56 (21.1%) always advised it. For myoclonus, the most frequently used first-line drug was valproate (181, 68%), followed by levetiracetam (58, 21.8%). Most (150, 56.4%) of the respondents favored personalized therapy for the individual patient in terms of the duration of disease-modifying treatment. The patient follow-up was reported to be poor, with most (171, 64.3%) of the patients following up only occasionally and 24 (9%) respondents indicating that patients are lost to follow-up promptly after the initial visit. Conclusions: While SSPE remains a vaccine-preventable illness and the focus should be on prevention through vaccination, there is an unmet urgent need among Indian neurologists for better-defined treatment strategies for patients with SSPE.

AB  - The female reproductive system dysfunction considerably affects the overall health of women and children on a global scale. Over the decade, the incidence of reproductive disorders has become a significant source of suffering for women. Infertility in women may be caused by a range of acquired and congenital abnormalities. Ovaries play a central role in the female reproductive function. Any defect in the normal functioning of these endocrine organs causes health issues and reproductive challenges extending beyond infertility, as the hormones interact with other tissues and biological processes in the body. The complex pathophysiology of ovarian disorders makes it a multifactorial disease. The key etiological factors associated with the diseases include genetic factors, hormonal imbalance, environmental and lifestyle factors, inflammatory conditions, oxidative stress, autoimmune diseases, metabolic factors, and age. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to disease development and progression affecting the oocyte quality, fertilization, embryo development, and implantation. The choice of treatment for ovarian disorders varies among individuals and has associated complications. Reproductive tissue engineering holds great promise for overcoming the challenges associated with the current therapeutic approach to tissue regeneration. Furthermore, incorporating nanotechnology into tissue engineering could offer an efficient treatment strategy. This review provides an overview of incorporating antioxidant nanomaterials for engineering ovarian tissue to address the disease recurrence and associated pathophysiology. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) are prioritized for evaluation primarily due to their antioxidant properties. In conclusion, the review explores the potential applications of CeO2 NPs for effective and clinically significant ovarian tissue regeneration.

AB  - Background Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a cancer-associated immune checkpoint protein implicated in tumor-driven immune escape mechanisms. This study was undertaken to determine genetic variations at the 3'-UTR of the HLA-G gene that may alter its expression, identify risk alleles and genotypes for their association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and treatment responses in the Indian population.Objectives Case-control genetic association study of HLA-G gene UTR polymorphisms with HCC and response to locoregional therapy (LRT).Methods HCC cases (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 110) were recruited for the genetic association study, of which 88 patients received LRT. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the HLA-G 3'-UTR gene were genotyped by sequencing and PCR-RFLP. The genetic association of 14 SNPs with HCC and LRT responses was determined using population genetic approaches.Results Three of the 14 SNPs (rs1707, rs1710, and rs1063320) were found to be genetically associated with HCC risk and treatment responses. These three UTR SNPs are important for miRNA binding. We did not observe significant association of the most studied SNP, rs371194629 (INDEL, +2960), with HCC or treatment response. Serum sHLA-G levels were found to be significantly (p = 0.027) higher in HCC patients as compared to healthy controls. Highly prevalent UTR haplotypes in Indian HCC patients were UTR-4, -1, and -7 whereas in healthy controls it was UTR-3, and 15 as determined by a linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot using 8 SNPs.Conclusion HLA-G SNPs are genetically associated with HCC and treatment response. Haplotypes associated with high levels of HLA-G expression are more prevalent in HCC than in healthy controls.Core tip Population genetic approaches were used to study HLA-G gene polymorphisms in the Indian population for its genetic association with HCC risk, treatment response and altered gene expression. Out of the 14 SNPs studied for HLA-G UTR, three were linked to HCC and response to locoregional therapy. Linkage disequilibrium and UTR haplotyping analysis show that the UTR-4 haplotype linked to high HLA-G levels, is more common in HCC patients, while the UTR-3 haplotype, linked to low HLA-G levels, is more common in healthy controls. This study is the first to look at the UTR types based on HLA-G gene polymorphisms of Indian HCC patients and their response to therapy.

AB  - Autonomic function is an integral part of the assessment of neurological disorders. However, pragmatically, it is often the most neglected part of neurological examination and is often limited to testing for orthostatic hypotension. Testing the autonomic nervous system may aid in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, thereby enabling the initiation of neuroprotective strategies and resulting in improved quality of life in this group of patients. It may also enable differentiation between certain atypical parkinsonisms, such as Multiple System Atrophy and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, in which autonomic dysfunction is early and usually profound compared to Parkinson's disease. Our review focusses on the "first-line" autonomic function tests which can be done at the bedside and require use of minimal equipment and provide insights into cardiovascular, pupillary and sudomotor function. The use of minimal equipment underscores the value of these tests in resource-constrained settings as a major unmet need, thereby saving resources and avoiding delays in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Optically active ultrabright imaging agents are shown to delineate tumor location with deep tissue visualization in pre noclinical tumor models. NanoGhosts (NGs) particles are reconstructed from the cell membrane and integrated with organic fluorophores to attain ultra-brightness for solid tumor imaging. Moreover, the integration of amphiphilic and lipophilic molecules reveals structural characteristics of NGs (approximate to 70 nm), which also alter their brightness. Upon intravenous administration (10 mg kg-1 single dose), these ultrabright NGs (778 MESF) enable the high-resolution of tumor site and real-time tracking of vital organs with high-contrast fluorescence signals. Engineered biomimetic NGs demonstrates better resolution and tissue penetration as compared to the clinically approved indocyanine green (ICG). High precision in tumor detection (0.5 h) and strong tumor retention (24 h which is further up to 30th day) without affecting healthy tissues ensure the future scope of NGs in early-stage cancer imaging. These findings suggest that these NGs mimic the biological characteristics of native cells, enabling them to evade immune clearance and target the solid tumor naturally.

AB  - Background miRNAs are non-coding RNA that are recognized as biomarkers of kidney disorders. There is limited information on the differential expression of miRNA and their target genes in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood. Methods We enrolled patients, 2-18 years old, with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, either at onset or during relapse, and steroid-resistant disease, at diagnosis of steroid-resistance. Patients with steroid-sensitive disease were off immunosuppressive medications, while those with steroid-resistance were on therapy with prednisolone at enrollment. Controls were healthy children attending the hospital for vaccinations or for minor non-infectious, non-kidney ailments. Following RNA extraction from whole blood, differential expression of 2549 miRNAs was examined to identify differentially expressed miRNA, defined as those with absolute log2 fold change > 2 and adjusted P < 0.05. Target genes, predicted using miRNet, were compared against the genes for nephrotic syndrome in the NCBI database, and the ontology of selected genes was examined using DAVID. Results Comparison of miRNA expression in 36 patients and 12 controls led to the identification of 62 and 12 differentially expressed miRNA in patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant disease, respectively. Of 76 miRNAs that were differentially regulated between the two disease categories, 26 were unique to steroid-sensitive disease and 11 to steroid-resistance. Of 5955 and 2813 genes targeted by the miRNAs specific to steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, respectively, 79 were relevant in context of the disease. Conclusion Steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome have distinct miRNA expression profiles, which can be examined as biomarkers and in pathogenetic pathways.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy has been proven to be a fast, convenient, and nondestructive technique for advancing our understanding of biological systems. The Raman effect originates from the inelastic scattering of light which directly probe vibration/rotational states in biological molecules and materials. Despite numerous advantages over infrared spectroscopy and continuous technical as well as operational improvement in Raman spectroscopy, an advanced development of the device and more applications have become possible. In this review, we explore the principles, techniques, and myriad applications of Raman spectroscopy in the realm of biology. We begin by providing an overview of Raman spectroscopy, highlighting its significance in unraveling the complexities of biological research. The focus of this review is on Raman spectroscopy concepts and methods, clarifying the fundamentals of Raman scattering and spectral interpretation. The review also highlights the key experimental considerations for productive biological applications. We explore the broad range of Raman applications including molecular structure, biomolecular composition, disease detection, and medication discovery. The Raman imaging and mapping can also be used to visualize biological samples at the molecular level. Raman spectroscopy is still developing, giving fresh insights and remedies, from biosensing to its use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This review sheds light on the past, present, and future of Raman spectroscopy; it also highlights promising directions of future research developments and serves as a thorough resource for all researchers.

AB  - Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) has emerged as a key area of interest among researchers worldwide, including those in India, who have actively studied the disorder over the past several decades. This review meticulously explores the extensive range of Indian research on PSP up to the present and offers insights into both current initiatives and potential future directions for managing PSP within the region. Historical research contributions have spanned 80 publications from 1974 to 2023, encompassing diverse themes from clinical phenotyping and historical analysis to isolated investigative studies and therapeutic trials. Traditionally, these studies have been conducted in single centers or specific departments, involving a broad range of recruitment numbers. The most frequently encountered phenotype among these studies is PSP-Richardson's syndrome, with patients typically presenting at an average age of 64 years, alongside various other subtypes. Recently, there has been a significant shift toward more collaborative research models, moving from isolated, center-based studies to expansive, multicentric, and pan India projects. A prime example of this new approach is the PAn India Registry for PSP (PAIR-PSP) project, which represents a comprehensive effort to uniformly examine the demographic, clinical, and genetic facets of PSP across India. Looking ahead, there is a critical need for focused research on unraveling genetic insights, identifying risk factors, and developing effective treatment interventions and preventive models. Given its vast population, India's role in advancing our understanding of PSP and other tauopathies could be pivotal, and this work reflects the work on PSP in India till now.

AB  - BackgroundHealthcare-associated bloodstream infections (BSI) threaten patient safety and are the third most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI) in low- and middle-income countries. An intensive-care-unit (ICU) based HAI surveillance network recording BSIs was started in India in 2017. We evaluated this surveillance network's ability to detect BSI to identify best practices, challenges, and opportunities in its implementation.MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods descriptive study from January to May 2022 using the CDC guidelines for evaluation. We focused on hospitals reporting BSI surveillance data to the HAI network from May 2017 to December 2021, and collected data through interviews, surveys, record reviews, and site visits. We integrated quantitative and qualitative results and present mixed methods interpretation.ResultsThe HAI surveillance network included 39 hospitals across 22 states of India. We conducted 13 interviews, four site visits, and one focus-group discussion and collected 50 survey responses. Respondents included network coordinators, surveillance staff, data entry operators, and ICU physicians. Among surveyed staff, 83% rated the case definitions simple to use. Case definitions were correctly applied in 280/284 (98%) case reports. Among 21 site records reviewed, 24% reported using paper-based forms for laboratory reporting. Interviewees reported challenges, including funding, limited human resources, lack of digitalization, variable blood culture practices, and inconsistent information sharing.ConclusionImplementing a standardized HAI surveillance network reporting BSIs in India has been successful, and the case definitions developed were simple. Allocating personnel, digitalizing medical records, improving culturing practices, establishing feedback mechanisms, and funding commitment are crucial for its sustainability.

AB  - Oxidative and nitrosative stress play pivotal roles in normal physiological processes and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia in iNOS-/-mice, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal redox balance. These mice exhibited altered gut microbiota with decreased Lactobacillus . Therefore, we hypothesized that Lactobacillus supplementation could mitigate metabolic disturbances in iNOS-/-mice. To test this hypothesis, iNOS-/-mice and wild-type (WT) mice were divided into four groups: iNOS-/-with or without Lactobacillus supplementation, WT with or without Lactobacillus supplementation and glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, lipids, gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism (qPCR), fecal gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing), and serum and caecum metabolomics (LC-MS) were monitored. IR and dyslipidemic iNOS-/-mice exhibited reduced microbial diversity, diminished presence of Lactobacillus , and altered serum metabolites, indicating metabolic dysregulation. Lactobacillus supplementation in iNOS-/-mice effectively reversed glucose intolerance, IR, dyslipidemia, and associated metabolic irregularities compared to WT. These improvements correlated with changes in gene expression related to fatty acid synthesis in liver and adipose tissue, lipid oxidation in liver, and lipid efflux in intestinal tissue as compared to untreated iNOS-/-mice. Despite the positive effects on metabolic markers, Lactobacillus supplementation did not reduce body weight or rectify disrupted energy balance, as evidenced by reduced VCO2 production, heat generation, and metabolic rates in iNOS-/- mice. The results suggest that Lactobacillus supplementation ameliorates metabolic disturbances but did not fully restore disrupted energy balance, highlighting complex interactions between the gut microbiome and metabolism.

AB  - Background: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is an accepted and approved brain stimulation technique to treat patients with treatment-resistant depression. Aim: Using neuroimaging, this open-label study aimed to predict the response by observing glucose metabolism with the help of 18-FDG PET scan. Methods: A total of 25 treatment-resistant depression patients received 15 sessions of iTBS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Two FDG-PET scans were done for all the patients. Fifty-six percent of patients responded to treatment with iTBS. Results: We found that there was hypometabolism in left and right prefrontal lateral regions, left and right inferior parietal regions, and left prefrontal medial regions at baseline but no statistically significant difference in the metabolism between responders and nonresponders. Conclusion: We did not find any statistically significant difference in the metabolism between responders and nonresponders in any brain regions at T0 as well as T1. Further large-scale studies are required.

AB  - Diagnosing pediatric rheumatic diseases can be challenging, as they often mimic common conditions such as infections and, less commonly, malignancies. Characteristic pattern recognition, guided by a detailed history and clinical examination, often helps in making the correct diagnosis. A delay in diagnosing these disorders can lead to disease-related damage, such as joint disabilities in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and life-threatening organ involvement in conditions like childhood vasculitis and lupus. Easily accessible laboratory investigations can guide towards the underlying diagnosis. In the current era, early diagnosis helps achieve favorable outcomes with the use of effective therapeutic options. This article aims to highlight important clinical and laboratory features that would assist the primary care pediatricians in the early diagnosis of rheumatic disorders.

AB  - Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but preventable cause of acute hepatic dysfunction which is associated with significant mortality, unless treated appropriately. There are significant regional variations in the etiologies of ALF globally and this determines the outcomes of the disease as well as the long-term survival in patients receiving liver transplantation for management. Improvements in understanding of disease pathophysiology and critical care medicine have led to better outcomes over the last few decades. Despite this, the burden of indeterminate ALF and the pathogenesis of many etiological agents are yet to be fully known. Improvements in diagnostic and prognostic modalities are expected to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with ALF. Changes in vaccination programs and stronger legislative practices regarding over-the-counter sale of acetaminophen and non-proprietary drugs are expected to reduce the burden of disease globally.

AB  - Background: Optimal anticoagulation management in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) experiencing splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT) requires balancing risks of bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the incidence of bleeding and thrombosis recurrence in patients with MPN-SpVT. Methods: We included retrospective or prospective studies in English with >= 10 adult patients with MPN-SpVT. Outcomes included recurrent venous thrombosis (SpVT and non-SpVT), arterial thrombosis, and major bleeding. Pooled rates per 100 patient years with 95% CIs were calculated by DerSimonian-Laird method using random-effects model. Results: Out of 4624 studies screened, 9 studies with a total of 443 patients were included in the meta-analysis with median follow-up of 3.5 years. In the 364 patients with MPN-SpVT treated with anticoagulation, pooled event rate for major bleeding was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-5.1; I2 = 95%), for recurrent venous thrombosis was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8-2.2; I2 = 72%), and for arterial thrombosis was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6-3.3; I2 = 92%) per 100 patient years. Among 79 patients (n = 4 studies) who did not receive anticoagulation, pooled event rate for major bleeding was 3.2 (95% CI, 0.7-12.7; I2 = 97%), for recurrent venous thrombosis 3.5 (95% CI, 1.8-6.4; I2 = 88%), and for arterial thrombosis rate 1.6 (95% CI, 0.4-6.6; I2 = 95%) per 100 patient years. Conclusion: Patients with MPN-SpVT treated with anticoagulation have significant risks for both major bleeding and thrombosis recurrence. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal anticoagulation approach in patients with MPN-SpVT.

AB  - Purpose Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by increased adiposity with low skeletal muscle mass, contributes to frailty and the development of chronic disease. Data on sarcopenic obesity in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) is limited. Methodology A cross-sectional study on 65 cALL survivors (7-18 years, > 2 years from treatment completion) was conducted on cALL survivors with the primary outcome to determine the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as patients with a positive Fat Mass Index (FMI) z-score with a negative Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) z-score, measured using a Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan. In addition, we assessed the factors associated with sarcopenic obesity by multivariable regression analysis. Results The mean (+/- SD) age was 12.9 (+/- 3.2) years, the median (Interquartile Range) time since diagnosis was 6.5 (5.9;8) years, and 66% received cranial radiotherapy. Central obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome were seen in 21.5%, 23.1%, and 21% respectively. DXA-derived body composition variables revealed higher fat percentage despite normal body mass index (BMI) and lower muscle mass compared to the general population. Sarcopenic obesity was seen in 21 (34%) of survivors. On multivariable regression analysis, age at diagnosis (OR: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98), p = 0.02), central obesity (OR: 18.99 (95% 2.32-155.5), p = 0.006) and insulin resistance (OR: 10.2 (95% CI: 1.75-59.09), p = 0.01) were associated with sarcopenic obesity. Conclusions Sarcopenic obesity, an early clinical indicator for metabolic disease despite normal BMI, was significantly worse in children diagnosed with ALL at a younger age and was associated with central obesity and insulin resistance, which may contribute to adverse outcomes later in life.

AB  - PurposeTelemedicine use in healthcare is rising. However, infrastructural barriers may impede implementation in lower- and middle-income country settings. Patient perspectives regarding teleconsultation need to be explored. This study assesses the feasibility of teleconsultation among patients with cancer, patient satisfaction with its use, determinants of satisfaction, and its economic benefits.MethodsA cross-sectional telephonic interview-based study was conducted between February and September 2021 in a tertiary care cancer center in India. Adult patients with cancer or their caregivers who had availed of teleconsultation during the 6 months preceding the interview date were included. Teleconsultation was administered through email and telephone conversation. The research team developed an interview guide to elicit demographic details, satisfaction with teleconsultation, and the underlying reasons. Cost savings through teleconsultation were also recorded. Factors predicting subject satisfaction were identified by multivariable logistic regression.ResultsDuring the study period, 195 subjects, including 84 patients (43.1%) and 111 caregivers (56.9%), were interviewed. The median patient age at diagnosis was 31 years. In our study, 147 (75.4%) patients/caregivers reported satisfaction with teleconsultations. The benefits cited included better access and follow-up (n = 173, 88.7%) and saving time and money (n = 164, 84.1%). In multivariable analysis, a higher patient age (more than 30 years) was the only factor predictive of less satisfaction with teleconsultation. The median cost savings were not a predictor of satisfaction.ConclusionTeleconsultation is feasible and acceptable to most patients availing treatment in a tertiary oncology care setting in India. Patient and physician training for better communication may further improve the utility of this modality.

AB  - BACKGROUND:A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare phenylephrine boluses versus prophylactic infusion in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia on feto-maternal outcomes.METHODS:Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and US Clinical registry databases were searched. Studies comparing phenylephrine boluses (both therapeutic and prophylactic) with infusion (both fixed- and variable-rate) assessing various feto-maternal outcomes were included. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal hypotension. Secondary maternal outcomes included the incidence of reactive hypertension, bradycardia, nausea, or vomiting; secondary neonatal outcomes included umbilical arterial pH, partial pressure of oxygen (paO2), umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, Apgar Scores at 1 and 5 minutes. All outcomes were quantitatively analyzed using the random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration R0B 2.0 tool.RESULTS:We included 15 studies with 2153 parturients. The parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus during cesarean delivery under spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia had a significant increase in the incidence of predelivery hypotension compared to phenylephrine infusion (risk ratio [RR], 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-3.18). Reactive hypertension (RR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.29-0.79) and bradycardia (RR, 0.57, 95% CI, 0.41-0.79) were less common in the parturients receiving phenylephrine bolus; whereas, vomiting (RR, 2.15, 95% CI, 1.53-3.03) was more common compared to the infusion group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of nausea or any fetal outcomes (umbilical artery pH, paO2, umbilical venous pH, fetal acidosis, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes) between either of the groups. Three studies had a high risk of bias.CONCLUSIONS:A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion significantly reduces the incidence of predelivery hypotension in parturients undergoing cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia in comparison to the therapeutic or prophylactic phenylephrine bolus group. A prophylactic phenylephrine infusion may be considered in all parturients without preexisting hypertensive disorder or cardiovascular disorders to reduce the risk of predelivery hypotension. More evidence is needed to guide optimal hemodynamic management for patients with hypertensive or cardiovascular disorders.

AB  - Port site infection causes significant morbidity in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The umbilicus, the most common location for creating pneumoperitoneum, frequently harbours resident microflora, which can render a patient susceptible to subsequent port site infections. Umbilical hygiene and its role in preventing surgical site infections have not yet been studied. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by proposing a method for umbilical hygiene. Five hundred two patients planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised. In the intervention arm, the umbilicus was cleaned with 2-3 drops of coconut oil and patients were instructed to take a bath, with an emphasis on umbilicus cleaning. Patients in the control group were asked to bathe before surgery, without applying coconut oil. In both arms, the abdomen was painted using chlorhexidine, and a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done with the gall bladder being extracted through the epigastric port. Eight (or 1.5%) of the 480 patients had port site infections. Five of them had infections at the umbilical port site, of which four (p=0.200) belonged to the control group. Our study showed no statistically significant association between preoperative umbilical hygiene and port site infection. This might be due to the fact that patients in both arms bathed prior to the surgery and had their abdomen painted and deep cleaned with chlorhexidine. Hence, we would like to emphasise the significance of deep cleaning of the umbilicus with chlorhexidine during the painting of the abdomen. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed.

AB  - One of the key challenges in medical research is developing safe medications to treat neurodegenerative disorders. Increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are common features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT-1), part of the sirtuin family, plays a critical role in various physiological processes by binding to histones and nonhistone proteins. SIRT-1 primarily mitigates oxidative stress and regulates mitochondrial activity by maintaining the deacetylated form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), ensuring stable PGC-1 alpha levels. Research has shown reduced SIRT-1/PGC-1 alpha expression in AD and PD models. Targeting this pathway presents a promising therapeutic approach for managing AD and PD, potentially leading to disease-modifying treatments and improved outcomes. This review highlights the findings of various studies suggesting that the SIRT-1/PGC-1 alpha pathway promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as well as exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, offering a potential method for AD and PD treatment.

AB  - BackgroundInflammatory bowel diseases are complex chronic disorders with a relapsing-remitting course that affect the gut due to dysregulated immune response. The incidence of these disorders is increasing globally along with an increase in the incidence in pediatric population. Very early onset inflammatory bowel diseases are seen in children with age less than 6 years, where monogenic causes predominate. With the advent of next-generation sequencing methods, these disorders are being diagnosed more. Interleukin-10 receptor mutation-associated inflammatory bowel diseases is one such monogenic disorder where immunosuppression shows poor response.MethodsWe report the case of an 8-month-old child of Indian origin who presented with severe enterocolitis and rectovaginal fistulas. She was evaluated on lines of a very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. She was found to have a mutation in the interleukin-10 receptor causing severe enterocolitis. She underwent a diversion colostomy. She was admitted at 25 months of age for the hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplant (HSCT). The conditioning regimen used consisted of busulfan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte-globulin (ATG). The child received a 10/10 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched from a matched-unrelated adult female donor with bone marrow stem cell product at a dose of 5.6 million CD34+ cells per kg.ResultsShe was treated successfully by a matched unrelated donor HSCT. At present, she is 2 years and 4 months posttransplant and is cured.ConclusionsEarly recognition and prompt genetic testing can help in diagnosing and establishing the cause of a very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease caused due to interleukin-10 receptor mutations can be cured by HSCT.

AB  - The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive genomic landscape of Indian lung cancer patients. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of actionable alterations in lung adenocarcinoma and the novel discovery of frequent EGFR alterations in lung squamous carcinoma. Thus, this study underscores the potential for implementation of precision medicine and the need for novel therapeutic strategies tailored to Indian population. Background: The genomic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Indian patients remains under- explored. We revealed distinctive genomic alterations of Indian NSCLC patients, thereby providing vital molecular insights for implementation of precision therapies. Methods: We analyzed the genomic profiles of 325 lung adenocarcinoma and 81 lung squamous carcinoma samples from Indian patients using targeted sequencing of 50 cancer related genes. Correlations between genomic alterations and clinical characteristics were computed using statistical analyses. Additionally, we identified distinct features of Indian NSCLC genomes by comparison across different ethnicities. Results: Our genomic analysis revealed several noticeable features of Indian NSCLC patients. Alterations in EGFR (45.8%), TP53 (27.4%), ALK (11.4%) and KRAS (10.2%) were predominant in adenocarcinoma, with 68% eligible for targeted therapies. Squamous carcinoma exhibited prevalent alterations in TP53 (40.7%), PIK3CA (17.3%), and CDKN2A (8.6%). We observed higher frequency of EGFR alterations (18.5%) in lung squamous carcinoma patients, significantly distinct from other ethnicities reported till date. Beyond established correlations, we observed 60% of PD-L1 negative squamous patients harbored TP53 alterations, suggesting intriguing therapeutic implications. Conclusions: Our data revealed unique genomic variations of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma patients, with significant indications for precision medicine and clinical practice of lung cancers. The study emphasizes the importance of clinical utility of NGS for routine diagnostics.

AB  - Breast conserving therapy is now considered the preferred option for early invasive and in situ ductal (DCIS) breast carcinoma. In an attempt to decrease positive margin and local recurrence, various methods for margin delineation have been described. Our team at AIIMS New Delhi have developed a new technique of injecting methylene blue at the sonographically determined margin of tumour to delineate the margin of excision for breast cancer. We perform this procedure after immobilization of tumour with a transparent Ioban/Opsite adhesive sheet applied over the breast. The injection of blue dye at sonographically determined margins facilitates the lumpectomy with free margins.

AB  - Background Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Binding Protein 3 (IGF2BP3) promotes cancer migration and invasion by binding to several coding and non-coding RNAs. Hypoxia stimulates tumor progression by upregulating Hypoxia Inducible Factors and downstream signaling. Quaking (QKI) gene, which is upregulated in hypoxia and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), induces circular RNAs. Therefore, the axis between IGF2BP3, QKI, circular RNAs and their respective host genes under hypoxia was studied. Methods and results Several IGF2BP3-bound circular RNAs were previously identified in HepG2. There were 13 circRNAs originating from 8 host genes bound to IGF2BP3. We confirmed their binding to IGF2BP3 in U87MG using an RNA Immunoprecipitation assay. MALAT1, an oncogenic lncRNA was also found to be associated with IGF2BP3. Three adherent cell lines expressing high levels of IGF2BP3 viz., HeLa, HepG2 and U87MG were cultured under normoxia (20%O2) and hypoxia (<0.2%O2) for 48-168 h. Expression of IGF2BP3, QKI, EMT markers, IGF2BP3-bound circRNAs and their host mRNAs expression were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in both normoxia and hypoxia. The hypoxia markers viz., VEGF and CA9 were upregulated in all the cell lines in hypoxia at all time points along with an increase in SNAIL. We found 6 genes, viz., PHC3, CDYL, ANKRD17, ARID1A, NEIL3 and FNDC3B with increased expression both at the mRNA and circRNA level indicating their synergistic role in tumor initiation. Overall, we found that circRNA to mRNA expression was observed to be increased for most of the genes and time points of hypoxia in all the cell lines. IGF2BP3 and QKI were also upregulated in hypoxia indicating their role in circRNA biogenesis and stability. Conclusion Our data implies that hypoxia augments circRNA biogenesis which might subsequently play a role in tumor progression.

AB  - Corneal perforations are potentially sight-threatening conditions if not promptly treated. Management depends on the size, location, cause, and severity of the perforation. Various methods, including tissue adhesives, amniotic membrane grafting (AMG), and keratoplasty, are available. However, the limited availability of donor tissue in emergencies poses a significant challenge. Recently, Tenon's patch grafting (TPG) has emerged as a promising treatment option due to its autologous nature, availability, and lack of immunogenicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various aspects of TPG, along with relevant images. A literature search using keywords such as "Tenon's patch graft," "Tenon's capsule," "corneal patch graft," "amniotic membrane," and "corneal perforations" yielded 37 articles, included in this review. TPG is suitable for cases involving corneal tissue degradation leading to perforation, impending perforation, or descemetocele, with lesion sizes ranging from 2 to 6 mm. For larger perforations, the procedure may be modified by combining it with AMG or tissue adhesives. Postoperatively, the graft undergoes characteristic changes, including epithelialization and collagen deposition, resulting in the formation of a thick scar. Complications such as delayed epithelialization, wound leaks, and graft dehiscence can occur. High success rates have been reported, ranging from 74% to 87%. However, TPG may result in suboptimal visual outcomes, particularly when the graft is centrally located, necessitating future keratoplasty for visual rehabilitation. Overall, TPG is a safe and cost-effective technique for restoring structural integrity in corneal thinning disorders and perforations, especially in emergency settings when donor tissue is unavailable.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease of undetermined aetiology (CKDu) is an important public health problem. Indian data are mostly based on studies from rural regions in south and east India. We examined the burden and profile of CKDu in patients attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. Methods: We assessed records of consecutive new CKD patients registered in a nephrology clinic from January 2015 to June 2022. Patients were classified as having CKDu based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical and laboratory parameters at presentation and kidney biopsy when done were noted. Results: Records of 32,369 patients with CKD were screened, and 29,663 were included (2,706 excluded due to inadequate data). A total of 370 (1.2%) patients were categorized as CKDu. Mean age was 41 +/- 14.7 years, 58.1% being male. Of them, 158 (42.7%) patients were in CKD stage 3, 89 (24.1%) in stage 4, 84 (22.7%) in stage 5, and 39 (10.5%) were dialysis dependent at presentation; 232 (62.7%) patients had proteinuria <0.5 gm/day and 138 (37.3%) between 0.5 and 1 gm/day. Renal histology was available for 65 CKDu patients: 62 had chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) and 3 had non-specific changes. Conclusion: When defined using strict criteria with intensive diagnostic workup, burden of CKDu is low in our hospital-based cohort of CKD patients. CTIN is the predominant histopathological finding in kidney biopsy. (c) 2024 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - INTRODUCTION:Life-long adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) and its assessment is essential for patients with celiac disease (CeD). We have developed and validated a tool for assessing adherence to GFD which can be used by both physicians and dietitians. METHODS:Phase 1: Development, content validation, and assessment of reliability of tool. Phase 2: Validation of tool against standard dietary evaluation (SDE) (gold standard), immunoglobulin A - anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA anti-tTG Ab), and gluten immunogenic peptides in urine. Overall, 380 biopsy-confirmed patients with CeD (derivation cohort: n = 100 [phase 1], n = 210 [phase 2] and independent validation cohort, n = 70) were recruited. RESULTS:Of an initial 90-point questionnaire, 84 items (Celiac Disease: Compliance Assessment Test [CD-CAT.v1]) were retained after content validation and pilot testing. In phase 1, upon administering CD-CAT.v1 on 100 patients, a comprehensive 35-item tool (CD-CAT.v2; alpha = 0.86) was obtained after removing items with low test-retest reliability and item-rest correlation values. In phase 2, upon administering CD-CAT.v2 on 210 patients, 22 items were removed having low correlation values (R < 0.4) with SDE. Finally, a 13-item tool (CD-CAT.v3; alpha = 0.84) was obtained with high criterion validity with SDE (r = 0.806, P < 0.001), moderate convergent validity with celiac disease adherence test (r = 0.602, P = 0.007), and moderate to weak correlation with urine gluten immunogenic peptides (r = 0.46, P = 0.001) and IgA anti-tTG Ab (r = 0.39, P = 0.008), respectively. The final 13-item tool also strongly correlated with SDE (r = 0.78, P < 0.001) in an independent validation cohort of 70 patients with CeD. Principal component analysis identified 3 relevant subscales with a cumulative variance of 62%. The sensitivity and specificity of CD-CAT.v3 were 80% and 91%, respectively, with an area under curve of 0.905 with SDE. The obtained cutoff score of <19 from the receiver operating characteristic curve was further categorized as 13 = excellent, 14-18 = very good, 19-28 = average, and >28 = poor adherence to GFD. DISCUSSION:CD-CAT is a new and rapid tool for monitoring dietary adherence to GFD with high sensitivity and specificity, which can be administered by both physicians and dietitians.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present systematic review and meta-analyses was to appraise the case-control studies that have evaluated late adverse effects of chemotherapy for treating hematological malignancies in pediatric patients. Methods: Five electronic databases along with grey literature were searched using broad keywords and MeSH terms for the articles that could meet the eligibility criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed for quality assessment. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model using the (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) REML approach was used for meta-analyses to calculate the pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to synthesize the certainty of evidence utilizing GRADEpro (R) GDT software. Results: 8,052 records were obtained from the searches. After duplicate removal and initial screening of titles and abstracts, 109 articles were subjected to full-text reading but only 5 could be included. The pooled ORs of having root malformation, microdontia, tooth agenesis, taurodontism, and enamel defects in patients who have undergone treatment were 7.68, 5.39, 3.74, 2.00, and 1.84 compared to controls, respectively. The SMD for dental caries was also significant among the groups (p= 0.03) and indicated an SMD of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.51) indicating higher pooled mean DMFT in the cases than controls. Conclusions: Root malformations are associated with treatment for childhood hematological cancers with a moderate certainty of assessment. Tooth agenesis and microdontia are associated with low certainty of evidence, while taurodontism, enamel defects, and caries were associated with very low certainty of evidence. Future studies on larger sample sizes are needed to validate the findings as the number of studies included in our review was small.

AB  - Clinical biomarkers such as fasting glucose, HbA1c, and fasting insulin, which gauge glycemic status in the body, are highly influenced by diet. Indians are genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes and their carbohydrate-centric diet further elevates the disease risk. Despite the combined influence of genetic and environmental risk factors, Indians have been inadequately explored in the studies of glycemic traits. Addressing this gap, we investigate the genetic architecture of glycemic traits at genome-wide level in 4927 Indians (without diabetes). Our analysis revealed numerous variants of sub-genome-wide significance, and their credibility was thoroughly assessed by integrating data from various levels. This identified key effector genes, ZNF470, DPP6, GXYLT2, PITPNM3, BEND7, and LORICRIN-PGLYRP3. While these genes were weakly linked with carbohydrate intake or glycemia earlier in other populations, our findings demonstrated a much stronger association in the Indian population. Associated genetic variants within these genes served as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in various gut tissues essential for digestion. Additionally, majority of these gut eQTLs functioned as methylation quantitative trait loci (meth-QTLs) observed in peripheral blood samples from 223 Indians, elucidating the underlying mechanism of their regulation of target gene expression. Specific co-localized eQTLs-meth-QTLs altered the binding affinity of transcription factors targeting crucial genes involved in glucose metabolism. Our study identifies previously unreported genetic variants that strongly influence the diet-glycemia relationship. These findings set the stage for future research into personalized lifestyle interventions integrating genetic insights with tailored dietary strategies to mitigate disease risk based on individual genetic profiles.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to assess the acceptability of Mobile Direct Observed Therapy (MDOT) amongst the parents/caregivers of children with asthma. Methods This open-label pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled newly diagnosed children aged 5-15 years with asthma, who were followed up telephonically for six weeks. Parents of children in the intervention arm were requested to record a video of the metered dose inhaler with spacer (MDI-S) technique of their child on a mobile phone and share it through WhatsApp with investigator who then provided corrective measures as required by a text/video message. The children in the control arm continued follow-up telephonically without exchange of any videos for six weeks. The primary outcome measures were the acceptability of MDOT and the effect of such interaction on the correctness of the MDI-S technique. Secondary outcome measures were the level of asthma control as per GINA guidelines and the caregivers' perception and feedback about MDOT. Result A total of 30 children were enrolled, 15 in each arm. Thirteen (86%) parents uploaded good-quality videos. The average number of incorrect steps decreased from 2.64 in the first video to 0.18 after the fourth video and nil after the fifth video in the MDOT group. At six weeks of follow-up, the average number of incorrect steps was significantly lower in the MDOT group compared to the control group (0 vs 2.9; P < 0.001). The proportion of children having controlled asthma was better in the MDOT group compared to controls (85% vs 70%) (P = 0.39). All parents liked MDOT. Conclusions MDOT was well accepted by caregivers of children with asthma and was helpful in improving the MDI-S technique.

AB  - Introduction Pelvi-Ureteric Junction Obstruction (PUJO) is a common cause of hydronephrosis (HDN) in children. While ultrasonography (USG) is useful for initial assessment and grading of hydronephrosis, it cannot differentiate obstructive from non-obstructive cases. Renal Dynamic Scintigraphy (RDS) confirms the diagnosis but involves ionizing radiation exposure. Ureteric jets using colour Doppler USG have been proposed for diagnosing obstructive HDN. Objective Our study aimed to evaluate Ureteric Jet Frequency (UJF) and Relative Jet Frequency (RJF) in unilateral PUJO before and after furosemide (Lasix) administration, assessing their diagnostic and postoperative utility. Materials and methods Children (<14 years) with unilateral HDN underwent USG and RDS for PUJO diagnosis. Pyeloplasty was performed based on standard criteria. UJF and RJF were assessed before and after furosemide administration (0.5 mg/kg) by colour Doppler USG. The non-obstructed side was taken as the control. Follow-up included repeat RDS and ureteric jet assessment. Results Fifty-two cases were included. UJF (pre- and postLasix) was significantly lower in the obstructed side compared to the non-obstructed side at baseline and post-pyeloplasty (p < 0.0001). However, the baseline UJF difference between cases and controls was not significant (p > 0.05). UJF and RJF (pre- and post-Lasix) increased postoperatively. The UJF difference decreased postoperatively (p < 0.05). (attached Table) Conclusion UJF and RJF are useful for diagnosing and monitoring unilateral PUJO. The effect of furosemide on UJF needs to be assessed using additional studies with larger sample sizes to understand if it can affect UJF in a way similar to that noted in diuretic scintigraphy.

AB  - BackgroundCOVID19 is a pandemic that has affected millions around the world since March 2020. While many patients recovered completely with mild illness, many patients succumbed to various organ morbidities. This heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of COVID19 infection has posed a challenge to clinicians around the world. It is therefore crucial to identify specific organ-related morbidity for effective treatment and better patient outcomes. We have carried out serum-based proteomic experiments to identify protein biomarkers that can flag organ dysfunctions in COVID19 patients.MethodsCOVID19 patients were screened and tested at various hospitals across New Delhi, India. 114 serum samples from these patients, with and without organ morbidities were collected and annotated based on clinical presentation and treatment history. Of these, 29 samples comprising of heart, lung, kidney, gastrointestinal, liver, and neurological morbidities were considered for the discovery phase of the experiment. Proteins were isolated, quantified, trypsin digested, and the peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography assisted tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Data analysis was carried out using Proteome Discoverer software. Fold change analysis was carried out on MetaboAnalyst. KEGG, Reactome, and Wiki Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins were carried out using the STRING database. Potential biomarker candidates for various organ morbidities were validated using ELISA.Results254 unique proteins were identified from all the samples with a subset of 12-31 differentially expressed proteins in each of the clinical phenotypes. These proteins establish complement and coagulation cascade pathways in the pathogenesis of the organ morbidities. Validation experiments along with their diagnostic parameters confirm Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine, Cystatin C, and Catalase as potential biomarker candidates that can flag cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and respiratory disease, respectively.ConclusionsLabel free serum proteomics shows differential protein expression in COVID19 patients with morbidity as compared to those without morbidity. Identified biomarker candidates hold promise to flag organ morbidities in COVID19 for efficient patient care.

AB  - With advances in genetic testing increasing proportion of early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) are being identified to have an underlying genetic aetiology. This is can be in the form of either highly penetrant genes associated with phenotypes with monogenic or mendelian inheritance patterns or those genes known as risk factor genes which confer an increased risk of PD in an individual. Both of them can modify the phenotypic manifestation in a patient with PD. This improved knowledge has helped in deciphering the intricate role of various cellular pathways in the pathophysiology of PD including both early and late and even sporadic PD. However, the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity is a major challenge. Different deleterious alterations in a same gene can result in a spectrum of presentation spanning from juvenile to late onset and typical to atypical parkinsonism manifestation. Similarly, a single phenotype can occur due to abnormality in two or more different genes. This conundrum poses a dilemma in the clinical approach and in understanding the clinico-genetic correlation. Understanding the clinico-genetic correlation carries even more importance especially when genetic testing is either not accessible or affordable or in many regions both. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss briefly the approach to various PARK gene related EOPD and describe in detail the clinico-genetic correlation of individual type of PARK gene related genetic EOPD with respect to their classical clinical presentation, pathophysiology, investigation findings and treatment response to medication and surgery.

AB  - Despite many efforts, a comprehensive understanding and clarification of the intricate connections within cancer cell metabolism remain elusive. This might pertain to intracellular dynamics and the complex interplay between cancer cells, and cells with the tumor stroma. Almost a century ago, Otto Warburg found that cancer cells exhibit a glycolytic phenotype, which continues to be a subject of thorough investigation. Past and ongoing investigations have demonstrated intricate mechanisms by which tumors modulate their functionality by utilizing extracellular glucose as a substrate, thereby sustaining the essential proliferation of cancer cells. This concept of "aerobic glycolysis," where cancer cells (even in the presence of enough oxygen) metabolize glucose to produce lactate plays a critical role in cancer progression and is regulated by various signaling pathways. Recent research has revealed that the canonical wingless-related integrated site (WNT) pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis, directly and indirectly, thereby influencing cancer development and progression. The present review seeks to gather knowledge about how the WNT/beta-catenin pathway influences aerobic glycolysis, referring to relevant studies in different types of cancer. Furthermore, we propose the concept of impeding the glycolytic phenotype of tumors by employing specific inhibitors that target WNT/beta-catenin signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between the extent and severity of stress-induced ischemia and the extent and severity of anatomic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with obstructive CAD is multifactorial and includes the intensity of stress achieved, type of testing used, presence and extent of prior infarction, collateral blood flow, plaque characteristics, microvascular disease, coronary vasomotor tone, and genetic factors. Among chronic coronary disease participants with site-determined moderate or severe ischemia, we investigated associations between ischemia severity on stress testing and the extent of CAD on coronary computed tomography angiography. METHODS: Clinically indicated stress testing included nuclear imaging, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nonimaging exercise tolerance test. Among those with preserved renal function who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography, we examined relationships between ischemia and CAD by coronary computed tomography angiography, overall, and by stress test modality, regardless of subsequent randomization. Core laboratories categorized ischemia as severe, moderate, mild, or none, while the extent and severity of anatomic CAD were categorized based on the modified Duke prognostic index. RESULTS: Among 3601 participants with interpretable stress tests and coronary computed tomography angiography, ischemia severity was weakly associated with CAD extent/severity (r=0.27), with modest variability in strength of association by modality: nuclear (n=1532; r=0.40), echocardiography (n=827; r=0.15), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n=108; r=0.31), and exercise tolerance test (n=1134; r=0.18). The extent of infarction on nuclear imaging and echocardiography was weakly associated with CAD extent/severity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ischemia severity on stress testing showed weak to moderate associations with the anatomic extent of CAD in this cohort with moderate or severe ischemia on local interpretation and controlled symptoms.

AB  - Purpose: Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in form of tumor necrosis predicts outcome in osteosarcoma; although response-adapted treatment escalation failed to improve outcome among patients treated with high- dose methotrexate-based (HDMTx) chemotherapy. This study aimed to identify factors predicting tumor necrosis and its impact on survival among patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma treated with a response- adapted non-HDMTx regimen. Methods: A retrospective single-institutional study was conducted among non-metastatic osteosarcoma patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy between 2004-2019. Patients were treated uniformly with three cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin/doxorubicin. Post-operatively, patients with favourable necrosis (>= 90 %) received 3 cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin, while patients with poor necrosis (<90 %) received escalated treatment with alternating six cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin and ifosfamide/etoposide. Propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were conducted to ascertain independent impact of necrosis on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 594 registered osteosarcoma patients, 280 patients (median age 17 years; male 67.1 %) were included for analysis. 73 patients (26.1 %) achieved favourable necrosis. Patients with smaller tumor size (<10 cm) (aOR = 2.28; p = 0.030), lower serum alkaline phosphatase (<450 IU/L) (aOR = 2.10; p = 0.035), and who had surgery earlier (<115 days) (aOR = 2.28; p = 0.016) were more likely to have favourable necrosis. On 1:2 PSM analysis, patients not achieving favourable necrosis demonstrated inferior EFS (HR = 2.68; p = 0.003) and OS (HR = 3.42; p = 0.003). Conclusions: Patients of osteosarcoma with smaller tumor, lower serum alkaline phosphatase and earlier surgery are more likely to achieve favourable necrosis. Tumor necrosis independently predicts outcome in osteosarcoma, and response-adapted treatment escalation fails to overcome the adverse impact of poor necrosis in non-HDMTx based regimen.

AB  - Breast conservation surgery is the standard of care for patients with early breast cancer. Although most surgeons perform oncoplasty for closure of defect, there is no randomised evidence for its favour as compared to simple closure of breast defect. We compared the cosmetic outcomes of patients treated by oncoplasty versus simple closure with 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. One hundred and four patients with breast cancer were randomised to four groups: excision with 1-cm margin with simple closure or excision with 2-cm margin with simple closure; excision with 1-cm margin and oncoplasty; and excision with 2-cm margin oncoplasty. Fifty-two patients underwent oncoplasty and 52 patients had simple closure of breast defect. There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcomes in patients undergoing oncoplasty compared to simple closure. Excision with 2-cm margin compared to 1 cm did not worsen the cosmetic outcome. The margin positivity and re-excision rates were higher with 1-cm margin and oncoplastic closure group (p-value 0.018). There was no significant difference in complications between oncoplasty compared to simple closure, and 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. Simple closure demonstrated similar cosmesis as compared to oncoplasty.

AB  - Microvascular complications of diabetic retinopathy (DR) may require surgical intervention in the form of vitrectomy. Since its inception, diabetic vitrectomy has evolved with introduction of better instruments, newer techniques, and smaller port sizes. Common indications for diabetic vitrectomy include nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, progression of fibrovascular membranes despite laser therapy, recalcitrant diabetic macular edema, and neovascular glaucoma. Preoperative systemic stabilization is essential prior to planning surgery. Surgical techniques commonly used in diabetic vitrectomy are segmentation, delamination, and rarely en-bloc dissection. Modification in surgical techniques such as chandelier-assisted bimanual dissection and pharmacological adjuvants improve surgical outcomes in these patients. Prognosis in these patients could be improved with early intervention. Studies evaluating the outcome of vitrectomy in patients with early proliferative DR are required to understand the appropriate time of intervention in patients. Treatment aimed at arresting the progression of DR and gene therapy are avenues that need further evaluation. The following review will focus on covering the epidemiology of DR, indications of vitrectomy, preoperative considerations, surgical procedures of diabetic vitrectomy, methods of membrane dissection, pharmacological adjuvants to vitrectomy, outcomes of diabetic vitrectomy, and future directions of diabetic vitrectomy.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sudden halt in the academic activities of many medical professionals including burns and plastic surgery. Worldwide, this led to many societies switching over to various virtual platforms like Google Meet and Zoom for teaching and training. In India, as the other plastic surgery societies started their educational webinars, the National Academy of Burns India (NABI) also geared up for its web journey for imparting burn education to doctors and the general population. Methodology: Webinars were conducted in four series - acute burn care, post-burn reconstructions, video demonstrations of burn procedures, and research in burns. The first series included a specialist from an allied department. To reach the public and non-medical population, the burn tutorials for general awareness were live-streamed on social media, and the teaching was done in the form of a panel discussion between the speakers and moderators. Results: A total of 54 webinars including 29 for professionals and 25 for the public were conducted between October 2020 to December 2023 in four series. The participation of professionals on the virtual platform was comparable to a burns conference and an extremely encouraging response was received to the NABI tutorials conducted on social media for the public. Conclusion: NABI webinars showed that education in burns is possible on a virtual platform under special circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic and can be used as an adjunct to

AB  - Head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a challenging oncological entity with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Despite advances in conventional therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the overall survival rates for advanced HNC remain suboptimal. In recent years, the emerging field of oncolytic virotherapy has gained attention as a promising therapeutic approach for various malignancies, including HNC. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of oncolytic viruses (Ovs) in the context of HNC treatment, including their mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical studies, challenges, and future directions. Future oncolytic virotherapy focuses on improving delivery and specificity through nanoparticle carriers and genetic modifications to enhance tumor targeting and immune response. Combining different OVs and integrating them with immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could overcome tumor resistance and improve outcomes. Personalized approaches and rigorous clinical trials are key to ensuring the safety and effectiveness of virotherapy in treating HNC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess real-time intraoperative pachymetry changes occurring during corneal cross-linking (CXL) using microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (Mi-OCT) and compare accuracy of various modalities of pachymetry assessment. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational comparative study including 45 consecutive patients with progressive keratoconus planned for CXL. Mi-OCT (RESCAN 700) was used to measure central corneal thickness (CCT) during four stages of CXL: before epithelial debridement, after debridement, after riboflavin instillation, and after ultraviolet irradiation. Scheimpflug imaging, anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT), and ultrasound pachymetry were used to assess CCT preoperatively. All data were entered into Excel software (Microsoft Corporation) and analyzed. RESULTS: The CCT significantly decreased after each step of CXL as measured on Mi-OCT (P < .0001). Mi-OCT overestimated the CCT significantly by 1.12 times on average (range: 1.02 to 1.43) compared to ultrasound pachymetry (P = .0004). CCT measured using Scheimpflug imaging and anterior segment OCT was statistically comparable to ultrasound pachymetry. CONCLUSIONS: Mi-OCT provides a real-time assessment of CCT during CXL. However, because it overestimates the pachymetry, ultrasound pachymetry remains the gold standard for decision-making during CXL.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the common biliary tract malignancies that is often associated with late presentation of clinical symptoms resulting in poor prognosis, thereby considerably increasing the mortality rate. Geographic and ethnic variations are one of the major causes of GBC incidence. However, in addition to genetic susceptibility to GBC, other factors like age, obesity, sex, and exposure to certain heavy chemicals may also lead to the incidence of GBC. Most of GBC research has so far used traditional cell culture systems. Recently, newer approaches using 2D and 3D cultures, xenograft models, and organoids are also becoming popular. However, whole organism model systems for GBC research have not yet been established. In this study, the authors propose the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study GBC. However, the zebrafish gallbladder is relatively unexplored besides the anatomical features. Here, the authors unravel and then compare the unique transcriptomic profile of zebrafish gallbladder with humans to identify genes consistently expressed in both species. The authors provide a comprehensive list of all gallbladder specific genes in zebrafish that also have their orthologous counterparts in humans. Therefore, they can be used as potential biomarkers for gallbladder transcriptomic profile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study so far to provide a complete genomic expression profile of zebrafish gallbladder along with an exhaustive cross-species comparison, thus paving the path for using zebrafish as a model organism to study GBC and help identify novel biomarkers for its early detection and diagnosis.

AB  - 10X Visium, a popular Spatial transcriptomics (ST) method, faces limited adoption due to its high cost and restricted sample usage per slide. To address these issues, we propose Microarray Integrated Spatial Transcriptomics (MIST), combining conventional tissue microarray (TMA) with Visium, using laser-cutting and 3D printing to enhance slide throughput. Our design facilitates independent replication and customization in individual labs to suit specific experimental needs. We provide a step-by-step guide from designing TMAs to the library preparation step. We demonstrate MIST's cost-effectiveness and technical benefits over Visium and GeoMx Nanostring. We also introduce 'AnnotateMap', a novel computational tool for efficient analysis of multiple ROIs processed through MIST.

AB  - ObjectiveThe present study sought to compare the reliability and radiation dose of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring using low tube current (16 mAs), low kilo-voltage peak (100 kVp) and advanced modelled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE 5) with the standard protocol (80 mAs, 120 kVp, ADMIRE 3). Material and methodsA prospective single centre study including 200 consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred for CT coronary angiography was conducted. All 200 patients underwent CAC scoring using the low current-low kVp protocol as well as standard protocol and were subdivided into a derivation and validation cohorts. ResultsCorrelation between CAC scores obtained using low current-low kVp protocol and standard protocol in derivation cohort was excellent (r = 0.99; p < 0.001). A linear regression model was used to derive a formula for predicting CAC that enabled conversion of CAC(low current-low kVp) to CAC(corrected) [CAC(corrected) = 1.067 x CAC(low current-low kVp)]. The formula was applied in validation cohort where CAC (corrected) showed excellent agreement with CAC(standard) (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.9970; 95%CI, 0.9956-0.9980). Excellent agreement for risk classification (weighted kappa, 0.94379; 95%CI, 0.89629-0.99130) was observed between CAC(corrected) and CAC(standard) scores. The low current-low kVp protocol demonstrated an 88.87% reduction in radiation dose (0.0679 +/- 0.01032 mSv vs. 0.610 +/- 0.2403 mSv; p < 0.0001). ConclusionThe low current-low kVp protocol for CAC scoring has comparable reliability to the standard technique with significant radiation dose reduction. This extremely low-dose protocol may prove useful as an alternative to standard CAC scoring, particularly for screening in the low-to-intermediate risk population.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by impaired differentiation of myeloid cells leading to hematopoietic failure. Despite advances, the molecular mechanisms driving AML remain incompletely understood, limiting the identification and targeting of critical vulnerabilities in leukemic cells. Homeobox (HOX) genes, encoding transcription factors essential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, are distributed across four clusters: HOXA (chromosome 7), HOXB (chromosome 17), HOXC (chromosome 12), and HOXD (chromosome 2). In addition to protein-coding sequences, HOX clusters encode non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are functional as transcripts and do not translate into proteins. This is the first study wherein we comprehensively reviewed the literature for HOX-embedded ncRNAs, encompassing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs), and piwiRNAs with a role in AML. To date, there is no evidence of circular RNAs and piwi RNAs encoded from the HOX gene clusters. Our review focuses on how leukemic cells harness the regulatory mechanisms of HOX-cluster-derived ncRNAs, (predominantly HOXA and HOXB) to modulate expression of HOX transcription factors facilitating leukemogenesis. HOX ncRNAs either regulate genes on the same chromosome (e.g., lncRNA HOTTIP) or influence expression of genes on different chromosomes (e.g., HOTAIR, HOX10-AS, miR-196b, and miR-10a). We discuss how specific HOX ncRNA networks are leveraged by leukemic cells, presenting an opportunity to explore targeted therapies and address the molecular heterogeneity of AML. Additionally, the aberrant expression of HOX ncRNAs such as HOXB derived ncRNAs in NPM1 mutated AML suggests their potential utility as improved biomarkers and for prognostication of patients with specific molecular aberrations.

AB  - Objective Advanced glycation end products/receptor for AGEs (AGE/RAGE) signaling has a well-established role in the etiology of diabetic-related cardiovascular disorders. The purpose of the study was to elucidate the role of chrysin, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in diabetic rats and its functional interaction with the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway.Methods A single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 70 mg/kg) was administered to rats for induction of diabetes. Rats having blood glucose levels more than 300 mg/dl following a 72 hr STZ injection were classified as diabetic. PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), chrysin (60 mg/kg, p.o.), or both were administered to diabetic rats for 4 weeks. On the 29th day, rats were given ischemia for 45 min and then reperfusion for 1 hr to induce myocardial infarction (MI).Key findings Pretreatment with chrysin significantly improved hemodynamic status, ventricular functions, and cardiac injury markers in diabetic myocardium. Increased PPAR-gamma/Nrf2 and decreased RAGE protein expressions were linked to this improvement. Chrysin pretreatment resulted in the upregulation of endogenous antioxidants and reduced TBARS levels. Moreover, chrysin significantly decreased inflammation and apoptosis in diabetic myocardium.Conclusion PPAR-gamma/Nrf2 co-activation by chrysin ameliorated IR-induced MI in diabetic rats, possibly via modulating AGE/RAGE signaling.

AB  - Background: Anal cancer is an uncommon cancer in the general population, with an average worldwide incidence of 1.9 per 100,000 men and women per year from 2017 to 2021. We conducted an observational study on HIV-infected males who attended the ART clinic at AIIMS New Delhi to study the prevalence of anal cytopathological abnormalities as well as anal HPV nucleic acid, along with a risk factor assessment for the same. Methods: Participants' inclusion criteria encompassed HIV-positive male patients over the age of 18 years who were attending the ART clinic. Following this, an anal cytopathological sample was collected for each participant. Results: Of these 65 samples, 8 (12.3%) tested positive for high-risk HPV DNA by PCR. Out of these, 2 were genotype 16, 1 was genotype 16 / 18 co-infection, 1 was genotype 16 / other high risk genotype coinfection, and the remaining 4 were other high-risk genotypes (apart from 16 to 18). Overall, ASCUS was reported in 14 (21.5%), LSIL and ASC-H were reported in 2 (3.1%) each, and LSIL with ASC-H was reported in 1 (1.5%). There was no statistically significant difference overall between distribution of cytology results among HPV DNA positive and negative samples. Conclusion: This pilot observational study conducted amongst adult males living with HIV showed a 12.3% prevalence of high-risk HPV DNA in anal brush cytological samples, which increased to 25% among the subgroup of homosexual participants. The most common HPV genotype found was genotype 16. Receptive anal intercourse, lower frequency of condom use and higher socio-economic class were found to be significant risk factors for HPV DNA positivity.

AB  - The p53 tumor suppressor is one of the most mutated genes responsible for tumorigenesis in most human cancers. Out of 29,891 genomic mutations reported in the TP53 Database (https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/), 1,297 are identified as unique missense somatic mutations excluding frameshift, intronic, deletion, nonsense, silent, splice, and other unknown mutations. We have comprehensively analyzed all these 1,297 unique missense mutations and created a phenotypical map based on the distribution of mutations in each domain, the functional state of the protein, and their occurrence in different types of tissues and organs. Our mutation map shows that almost 118 unique missense mutations are reported in the transactivation and proline-rich domains, 1,065 in the central DNA-binding domains, and 113 in the oligomerization and regulatory domains. Based on the phenotype, these mutations are subdivided into 46 super trans, 491 functional, 315 partially functional, and 415 non-functional mutations. The prevalence of these mutations was checked in 71 different types of tissues and found that the mutant R248Q is reported in 51 types of tissues followed by R175H and R273H in 46 types. We correlated the potential impact of mutation in target gene transcription and regulation with nucleosomal DNA and RNA-Pol II complexes. We have discussed the impact of mutation at post-translational modification sites in the structure and function of p53 highlighting the potential therapeutic drug targets with tremendous clinical applications.

AB  - Lamins play a crucial role in maintaining nuclear structure and function. Our study investigates the expression patterns and clinical implications of B-type lamins with a special focus on lamin B2 across various cancer types using comprehensive RNA sequencing datasets. We found that high expression levels of lamin B1 and lamin B2 are associated with decreased overall and disease-free survival in cancer. This association is further pronounced when both lamins are co-expressed, indicating a compounded negative impact on patient prognosis. Additionally, we highlighted the relationship between B-type lamins and the tumor microenvironment. Lamin B1 mRNA expression shows a strong positive correlation with activated CD4+ T-cells and type 2 T-helper cells (Th2), suggesting its role in immune cell infiltration and response within tumors. Lamin B2 expression also correlates moderately with these immune cells, indicating a potential but lesser role in modulating the immune landscape. Notably, the epigenetic state of lamin B1 significantly affects the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a dual role in structural integrity and immune modulation. We have identified 9 lamin B2 interacting proteins that are co-expressed with B-type lamins in cancerous conditions and modulate cytokinesis and cell division pathways during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we have identified specific molecular targets of B-type lamins that co-express with them in a range of human cancers and are potentially involved in dysregulating chromosome segregation and mRNA binding. Overexpression of these targets alongside B-type lamins correlates with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. These findings underscore the potential of B-type lamins as biomarkers for poor prognosis and as targets for cancer therapies.

AB  - Purpose To compare the volume, fat content, and T1 relaxation time of the pancreas in participants with and without prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods In this prospective case-control study, we enrolled 29 women with prior GDM, and divided them into three groups (normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic) based on their glycaemic status in the postpartum period; and a group of 13 participants as controls who had normoglycemia during pregnancy. Participants underwent MR examination including an axial multi-echo DIXON-based sequence and an axial-oblique T1 mapping sequence. The average proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T1 value of the pancreas were measured by drawing multiple circular regions of interest (ROIs). Average hepatic PDFF was similarly calculated. Pancreatic volume was computed by summating cleaned freehand ROIs outlining pancreatic parenchyma. Results Women were evaluated at a mean age of 32.9 +/- 4.0 years and with a mean BMI of 25.2 +/- 2.9 kg/m2. The median (IQR) duration of follow-up after childbirth was 24 (34-44) months. In controls, the pancreatic PDFF, T1 value, and volume were 5.4 +/- 2.3%, 850.6 +/- 101.6 ms, and 69.3 +/- 16.2 cm(3), respectively, while in subjects with a history of GDM, these values were 4.7 +/- 2.0%, 844.6 +/- 91.8 ms, and 69.8 +/- 16.6 cm(3), respectively. No statistical differences were observed (all p > 0.05). Mean hepatic PDFF was significantly higher in the diabetic and prediabetic groups (12.2 +/- 6.4% and 11.0 +/- 7.6% respectively) than in the control and normoglycemic groups (7.9 +/- 7.3 and 4.7 +/- 1.6% respectively; p -0.01). Conclusion We did not find any significant changes in pancreatic volume, fat content, or fibrosis in women with prior GDM and with different glycaemic categories when evaluated in the early postpartum period, compared to the control group. These findings may be a consequence of the transient state of insulin resistance in GDM and the finite duration of the disease course in new-onset prediabetes and diabetes patients.

AB  - Clear cell tumors of parotid gland encompass a wide spectrum of neoplasms, including benign and malignant epithelial neoplasms. Additionally, tumors from adjacent structures such as paraganglioma, and metastatic neoplasms may also show clear cells. Overlapping cytological features may cause difficulty in diagnosis. This 50-year-old female presented with inability to close the right eye for 4 years, and with an infra-auricular swelling. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) done outside was submitted for review with a diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor. Smears showed clusters of tumor cells with abundant vacuolated cytoplasm and uniform round to ovoid nuclei. Features were those of salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, that is Milan category IVB: cellular neoplasm with clear cell features, with differential diagnoses of myoepithelial cell neoplasms, acinic cell carcinoma and paraganglioma. FNAC repeated for better characterization showed similar polygonal cells, accompanied by few spindle-shaped cells with ovoid nuclei, suggestive of paraganglioma. However, DOTANOC uptake was absent. Patient underwent radical parotidectomy; intraoperative frozen section showed a spindle cell tumor. Final histopathology revealed an intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma. The tumor was multi-nodular, with some nodules being composed almost entirely of polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm, that is, Antoni B areas, and others showing typical Antoni A areas admixed with Antoni B areas. Parotid FNAC has high accuracy for diagnosis of epithelial lesions; however, mesenchymal tumors often pose a diagnostic difficulty. Intraparotid schwannoma is not uncommon and may be diagnosed easily on FNAC when morphology is classical. However, intra-tumoral heterogeneity and less common histological subtypes may present a pitfall in cytodiagnosis.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are increasingly recognized as environmental contaminants with potential health risks. These emerge as breakdown products of larger plastics and are omnipresent in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are primarily composed of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and additives that enhance their performance. MPs also adsorb harmful environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, posing risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to MPs occurs mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with MPs detected in food products, water, and even the air. MPs have been shown to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the gut microbiome, and causing dysbiosis-a harmful imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria. This disruption has been linked to various health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders, systemic inflammation, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis may be affected, with potential neuroinflammatory consequences. As research continues to unravel the health impacts of MP exposure, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and the broader implications on human health is crucial. This review highlights the effects of MPs on human health, emphasizing their impact on the gut microbiome. We discuss the potential connections between MP exposure and cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, and disorders related to the Gut-Brain Axis. By synthesizing the latest research, this work sheds light on the silent yet pervasive threat posed by MPs and underscores the importance of further studies to understand their health impacts fully.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful tool for biomolecule sensing. When combined with a broadband plasmonic structure, label-free, highly sensitive detection of specific molecules is possible. It is non-invasive, sensitive, fast, and can be used for in-situ analysis, unlike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence immunoassay, and radioimmunoassay. However, one of the challenges is to have an active SERS substrate that is uniform, sensitive, and specific to molecules of interest. In this work, we report plasmonic quasicrystal (PlQC) as a highly sensitive (enhancement factor approximate to 1014), uniform, reproducible, and stable (concerning time and ambient conditions) SERS active substrate. Herein, we present the label-free sensing of standard cotinine (up to 1 ng/mL), the ideal biomarker for nicotine exposure due to its long lifetime compared to nicotine. In addition, up to 1 nanogram level of cotinine has also been detected in synthetic urine and saliva employing PlQC as a SERS-active substrate. Our results on the principal component analysis of Rhodamine 6G and Cotinine demonstrate that broadband, dispersionless PlQC is suitable for label-free detection of single biomolecules.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the performance of intravoxel incoherent motion and diffusion kurtosis imaging (IVIM- DKI) in response assessment of rectosigmoid carcinoma to chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and compare with 18-FDG PET/CT parameters.Methods A total of 30 patients of recto-sigmoid cancer on CRT underwent baseline staging and follow-up with IVIM - DKI. Out of this cohort, 20 patients underwent 18-FDG PET/CT. IVIM- DKI MRI and PET/CT parameters were noted from both pre and post-chemoradiotherapy (done at 6 weeks after completion) scans. Quantitative IVIM-DKI parameters, viz. apparent (ADC) and molecular (D) diffusion coefficient, perfusion coefficient (f), and kurtosis (K) were measured from non-necrotic areas and semi-quantitative PET parameters including SUV max, SUV ratio, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were also measured. All these parameters correlated with the patient's response keeping RECIST 1.1 criteria as reference standard.Results A statistically significant increase in D and ADC with a significant decline in K was noted after therapy in the entire cohort. These changes were observed in both responders as well as non-responders. No significant differences were observed in the percentage changes of these parameters post therapy amongst both groups. Among 20 patients with follow-up PET/CT imaging, a significant decline in all parameters of primary lesion was seen post-therapy. Responders (n = 12) showed a significant decline in MTV and TLG from baseline after therapy, whereas non-responders did not show any such decline. Change in TLG (d TLG), followed by d MTV had the strongest correlation with a positive response. A d TLG value of >= 54.19 carried a 79% sensitivity and 83% specificity in differentiating responders from non responders.Conclusion 18-FDG PET/CT is a more accurate single modality for assessing both response and tumor burden post therapy, while ADC and D from IVIM MRI are useful adjuncts to response assessment.

AB  - BackgroundInternship is a phase of training wherein medical graduates acquire the skills and competencies required to function independently. It has been reported that interns lack confidence in performing common procedures, as these skills are often learnt through self-learning or performing without supervision. This type of learning endangers patient safety and fails to instil the required confidence in the student. Training in skills laboratories provide opportunity to learn clinical skills in a safe environment. However, skills laboratories are resource-intensive, and there is limited information on different training approaches, such as blended learning, and how the trainees perceive their usefulness. Hence, we conducted this pilot study to assess the perceived usefulness of a blended learning approach for skills training among medical interns.MethodsThis mixed methods study was conducted in the skills laboratory of an apex medical institute in India, among 42 interns posted for the Interns Skill-based Clinical Induction Program (ISCIP). In this training, a blended learning approach was adopted, which comprised of two components - an online e-learning module, followed by a hands-on training session. The trainees were asked to complete a feedback form and grade different components of the online session, and hands-on session on a five-item Likert-based scale. The scores were expressed as the mean (SD) of a maximum possible score of 5 for each of the components. In order to gain insight of the perceived usefulness of skills training among learners, focused group discussions (FGDs) were conducted.ResultsThe mean (SD) score for perceived importance ranged from 5 (0) to 4.9 (0.2) for various skills. The proportion of interns who felt confident in performing the skill after the training was 88.1% for IV cannulation to 97.6% handwashing, and gloving and gowning. The findings of the qualitative component revealed that interns found the training to be useful and interesting. It was perceived to be more ethical, uniform, well-structured, and provided an opportunity to practice a skill repeatedly.ConclusionsThe blended learning approach was perceived to be useful among the medical interns. Further research may be conducted in other medical institutes to assess the effectiveness of skills training.Clinical trial registration numberNot applicable, as the study is not a trial.

AB  - Background: Statins are linked to the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). While atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are often associated with NODM, pitavastatin may carry a lower risk. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) evaluated the impact of pitavastatin on NODM compared to atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Two authors independently screened studies, assessed the risk of bias using Joanna Briggs Institute, Newcastle-Ottawa, and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists, and extracted data. The analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1, and results were represented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I-2 statistic. Results: Of 517 records screened, 13 studies were included, comprising observational studies, and randomized controlled trials. Most of the studies showed pitavastatin to be associated with a lower or no risk of NODM. Meta-analysis revealed that pitavastatin had a lower risk of NODM compared to atorvastatin (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.79-0.93, p = 0.0002) and rosuvastatin (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.71-0.84, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: Pitavastatin poses a lower risk of NODM than other statins, making it a potentially safer option for patients requiring long-term statin therapy.

AB  - Objective: 4-butylcyclohexane carboxylic acid (4-BCCA), a low-affinity inhibitor of AMPA receptors at the transmembrane domain have been suggested as potential therapeutic option for epilepsy, but its potential impact on status epilepticus and disease-modification and neurodegeneration following status epilepticus have not been investigated. Methods: This study established the effect of 4-BCCA along with standard antiseizure medications (ASMs) [valproate (VPA) and perampanel (PER)] in Li-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus rat model. We first established the effective dose of 4-BCCA in status epilepticus followed by an acute and long-term effect study. Assessments of neurobehaviour (by elevated plus maze and passive avoidance), neurodegeneration [by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry in hippocampal slices], total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and neuronal loss [by neuron specific enolase (NSE) in cerebral tissue] were performed. Results: 4-BCCA at 200 mg/kg. i.p. was found to be an effective dose and in comparison, to other ASMs it showed better seizure control in terms of latency and number of stage 3/4 seizures. PER group and 4-BCCA+PER showed better memory retention but without significant difference among the drug-treated groups. In TEM, 4BCCA+PER and 4-BCCA+VPA group showed less nucleus and cytoplasmic changes. In immunohistochemistry 4BCCA, PER and combination groups showed better neuronal viability. 4-BCCA+ PER showed higher TAC and lower NSE level. Significance: 4-BCCA alone and its combination with ASMs especially perampanel in status epilepticus model in rats showed better seizure control and neuroprotection.

AB  - Management of traumatic dental injuries is often challenging due to the complexity in diagnosis, concomitant injuries, and the interdisciplinary treatment planning. As a result, the clinicians are often confused and not confident over important treatment decisions. The guidelines of International Association of Dental Traumatology have improved the standard of dental trauma care globally and provide a roadmap for predictable prognosis. However, there are unique situations that require additional investigations such as the Cone Beam Computed Tomography and customized treatment and follow up protocol. An essential requisite for prevention of adverse late complications of dental injuries is clear understanding of their etiopathogenesis and the changes that occur after an injury. Additionally, it is prudent to understand the basic physiology behind the healing that is expected after a treatment protocol. This review presents the science behind the development of late complications of dental injuries and their management protocols in a simplified and clinical manner. An attempt has been made to highlight the clinical paradigms and decisions that reduce the chances of failures in traumatized teeth.

AB  - Despite strides in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ESCC, patient survival rates remain relatively low. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating diverse cellular activities in humans. Dysregulated lncRNAs have emerged as potential diagnostic indicators across various cancers, including ESCC. However, further research is necessary to effectively leverage ESCC-associated lncRNAs in clinical settings. Understanding their clinical significance for ESCC diagnosis and their mechanisms can pave the way for more effective therapeutic strategies. Our qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant downregulation of SOX2-OT (similar to 2.02-fold) and NEAT1 (similar to 1.53-fold) in ESCC blood samples. These lncRNAs show potential as biomarkers for distinguishing ESCC patients from healthy individuals, with ROC curves and AUC values of 0.736 for SOX2-OT and 0.621 for NEAT1. Further analysis examined the correlation between SOX2-OT and NEAT1 expression and various clinicopathological factors, including age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, hot beverage intake, tumor grade, and TNM stages. In-silico studies highlighted their roles in miRNA sponging via mTOR and MAPK pathways, while co-expression network analysis identified associated genes. This research paves the way for future studies on ESCC prognosis using SOX2-OT and NEAT1 as predictive markers. By thoroughly investigating the functions of these lncRNAs, we aim to deepen our understanding of their potential as diagnostic markers and their role in facilitating effective therapeutic interventions for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) within clinical contexts.

AB  - Witteveen-Kolk syndrome (WITKOS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinct facial features, microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, and subtle neuroimaging abnormalities. The syndrome is attributed to a loss of function mutation in the SIN3A gene, a member of the switch-insensitive 3 transcription regulator family. Herein, we present a 21-year-old woman with dysmorphic facial features, short stature, and a chronic, progressively worsening symmetric cerebellar ataxia, along with generalized dystonia. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation in exon 7 of the SIN3A gene (c.1051 C>T, p.Pro351Ser), consistent with a diagnosis of WITKOS. Notably, dystonia has not been previously associated with this syndrome. This case underscores the clinical variability and broadens the phenotypic spectrum of WITKOS.

AB  - Introduction: A minority of addiction patients receive appropriate treatment directly from trained professionals in addiction medicine. Most countries have not recognized addiction medicine (AM) as a specialty in its own right or within psychiatry/other specialties. Therefore, the effectiveness and organization of AM training around the world need to be improved. Unfortunately, standard instruments are rarely used in most studies to assess training needs. This study aimed to determine international competencies in AM among professionals in as many countries as possible using a standard instrument such as the AM Training Needs Assessment (AM-TNA). Method: We examined competencies in AM with the AM-TNA using an online survey. A General Competency Level in Addiction Medicine (GLOCIAM30) was calculated by dividing the total score by the number of 30 items. This GLOCIAM30 was used to measure the general level of competency in AM and to compare individual competencies. Results: One hundred ninety-nine respondents from 45 countries completed the survey. Ninety-five of the 199 respondents (49.0%) had a GLOCIAM30 higher or equal to 4 (fairly competent). The highest skill level was found for the competency "Assessing substance use problems by taking the patient's history." Nine of the 45 countries had 8 or more respondents (n = 129). After post hoc analysis, there was no difference between these countries. Respondents could reasonably estimate whether the competency level in their country was higher or lower than the world average. Conclusions: This study is the first international attempt to examine competencies in AM. Although a much larger study population is needed to establish an overall goal for competencies in AM, our study provided an initial direction for such a gold standard in benchmarking procedures.

AB  - Purpose: Radiotherapy is frequently employed for palliative treatment in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) but radiation dose fractionation regimens are not well-defined. We designed this phase 3 randomized controlled trial to compare two weekly hypo fractionated regimes and study the effect on progression-free survival (PFS) in this subset of patients. Materials and Methods: Non-metastatic locally advanced HNSCC patients (n = 305) who were not suitable for curative treatment were randomized to Arm A (20 Gy/5#/5 days) and Arm B (30 Gy/5#/5 days). PFS and OS were recorded along with acute toxicity using patient-reported quality of life HN QLQ 43. Results: From April 2020 to August 2023, 390 patients were randomized, of which 305 were eligible for final analysis. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, PFS and median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 7.4 and 10.03 months, respectively. PFS (p-0.553) and OS (p-0.203) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Toxicity rates were similar between the two arms and dose escalation was well tolerated. Patients with a better PS were found to have significantly better OS. No significant benefit in OS or PFS was observed in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), underwent definitive conversion, or received palliative chemotherapy at progression. Conclusion: This is the largest phase 3 RCT to analyze the safety and efficacy of weekly palliative radiotherapy regimens and has not demonstrated further improvement with dose escalation.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the pain intensity in preterm infants during 48 h post retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening by binocular fundoscopy. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingsLevel-III-NICU in India. Participants83 Neonates undergoing first ROP screening. Main outcome measuresPain assessment using the premature infant pain profile-revised (PIPP-R) score at baseline and 5 min, 30 min, 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-procedure. ResultsThe mean gestation and birth weight was 29.8 (2.3) weeks and 1256 (344)g respectively. The median (IQR) PIPP-R score at baseline was 0 which significantly increased to 10.5 (8,12.5) 5 min (immediately) after the procedure. At 30 min and 6 h, scores were 7 (5,8) and 4.5 (3,5.5) respectively. After 24 h and 48 h, it decreased to 3 (0,5) and 0 (0,4.5) respectively. Nearly 59% (95%CI:40%-83%) of neonates had severe pain (PIPP-R score > 12) immediately after procedure. ConclusionA majority of neonates experience severe pain immediately after ROP screening, and mild-moderate pain continues for 6 h. Hence, an additional pharmacological agent should be considered for reducing neonatal pain.

AB  - The occurrence of large rectus sheath hematomas following erythropoietin injection is not commonly reported. In this case, the patient was known to have stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension and was on regular maintenance hemodialysis. She presented with a tender lump in the left iliac fossa, associated with a low hemoglobin level (5.4 g/dL). Further imaging revealed a large rectus sheath hematoma measuring 16 x 10 x 4.5 cm. The patient's history included an erythropoietin injection administered at the same site in the abdomen. Under hemodialysis support, digital subtraction angiography was performed, followed by angioembolization of the left inferior epigastric artery. The patient stabilized and was discharged after an uneventful recovery, with continued well-being at the 6-month follow-up. The hematoma was likely caused by an inadvertent intramuscular injection of erythropoietin, which may have injured the left inferior epigastric artery. The presence of CKD and hypertension likely contributed to the severity of the hematoma. While most rectus sheath hematomas are minor and self-limiting, large hematomas are rare and may require intervention.

AB  - Hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUSs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions, only some of which are mediated by complement (complement-mediated HUS). We report the outcome of the 2023 International Society of Nephrology HUS International Forum where a global panel of experts considered the current state of the art, identified areas of uncertainty, and proposed optimal solutions. Areas of uncertainty and areas for future research included the nomenclature of HUS, novel complement testing strategies, identification of biomarkers, genetic predisposition to atypical HUS, optimal dosing and withdrawal strategies for C5 inhibitors, treatment of kidney transplant recipients, disparity of access to treatment, and the next generation of complement inhibitors in complement-mediated HUS. The current rationale for optimal patient management is described.

AB  - The in vitro activity of two novel antibiotics with different modes of action, (i) siderophore cefiderocol and (ii) beta-lactam-enhancer mechanism-based cefepime/zide-Bactam, was tested against New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterial and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in India. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against multicentric NDM-producing Escherichia coli (n = 117), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 103), and P. aeruginosa (n = 72) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. Among E. coli, 111 isolates were NDM-alone, and six were NDM + OXA-48-like producers. Among K. pneumoniae, 47 and 56 isolates were NDM-alone and NDM + OXA-48-like producers, respectively. All E. coli isolates harbored four amino acid inserts in their penicillin-binding protein 3. Using the highest susceptible breakpoint among CLSI, FDA, and EUCAST interpretive criteria, cefiderocol susceptibility was 39.3%, <= 80%, and 57%, for NDM +/- OXA-48-like-producing E. coli, NDM +/- OXA-48- like-producing K. pneumoniae, and NDM-producing P. aeruginosa, respectively. At a cefepime break point of <= 8 mg/L, 100% of Enterobacterales and >= 90% of P. aeruginosa isolates were cefepime/zidebactam-susceptible. NDM being a dominant carbapenemase among Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa in India, the variable activity of cefiderocol against NDM producers is a concern. Post approval, cefepime/zidebactam could offer a promising treatment option against NDM producers

AB  - Oral cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in India and 5% of all cancers in women is contributed by oral cancer. In spite of being a part of national programme, the screening coverage rates remain low. Studies have indicated that the societal status of women and their empowerment plays a role in screening coverage for cancer. The objective of the current study is to estimate the coverage of oral cancer screening among Indian women within reproductive age-group across Indian states and union territories (UTs), to explore the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) and women empower status (WES) with oral cancer screening coverage across Indian states and union territories (UT). Data from the fifth round of the nationally representative cross-sectional survey (National Family Health Survey, NFHS-2019-2021) was used in the present study with 3,48,882 individuals being included in the final analysis. We have cross-tabulated SES and WES composite scores with the Dimension Index (DI) of screening and categorised states and UTs into low, middle and high. We have represented these values over the Indian map. The interaction among these was graphically represented by a bubble plot. Further, we estimated the association of each indicator of SES and WES with screening coverage using multivariable logistic regression. The national coverage of oral cancer screening among women of reproductive age was 0.77% with Andhra Pradesh (7%) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (10%) recording the highest screening coverage. Despite having high SES and WES scores, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the screening (DI) was low. States with both high women empowerment status and high socioeconomic status showed high oral cancer screening uptake but the trend was not universal. Still, there were variations in the association among the states. The increased screening was significantly associated with higher access to improved sanitary facility (76%) and clean fuel for cooking (44%). Socio-economic status is an important precursor for better oral cancer screening coverage but women empowerment status did not always translate into good cancer screening uptake. Deep-rooted socio-cultural constructs and stigma associated with cancer and its implications may play a role. Implementation research for better uptake of oral cancer screening coverage is required.

AB  - ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of urine cytology using The Paris System (TPS 2.0) in comparison with TPS 1.0, and the Four-Tier Reporting System (FTRS) of our institute for identifying high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC).MethodologyA total of 789 urine cytology specimens from 240 patients including 12 UTUC cases with available histological and clinical details were included. Two hundred twenty-two cases were newly diagnosed, whereas 18 were recurrent tumours. Histopathological evaluation categorised the cases as non-neoplastic (33%, 13.7%), low-grade urothelial neoplasms (LGUNs) (94%, 39.2%), high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUCs) (110%, 45.8%) and other malignancies (3%, 1.3%).ResultsTPS 2.0 categorised the cases as 14 (5.7%) non-diagnostic or ND/U, 99 (41.5%) NHGUC, 37 (15.4%) AUC, 24 (10%) SHGUC and 66 (27.5%) HGUC. TPS 1.0 had 14 (5.7%) ND/U, 72 (30%) NHGUC, 61 (24.5%) AUC, 3 (1.3%) LGUC, 24 (10%) SHGUC and 66 (27.5%) HGUC. FTRS classified them as 19 (7.5%) ND/UNS, 44 (18.3%) NEG, 88 (36.7%) INC and 89 (37.1%) POS. The ROHM for TPS 2.0 was 71.4% for ND/U, 12.1% for NHGUC, 29.7% for AUC, 79.2% for SHGUC and 89.4% for HGUC. TPS 1.0 showed a similar ROHM for ND/U, SHGUC and HGUC, whereas had 13.8% for NHGUC and 19.7% for AUCs. FTRS, had 78.9% for UNS, 6.8% for NEG, 35.2% for INC and 73.1% for POS. TPS demonstrated a sensitivity of 70.91% and specificity of 90.77% for identifying HGUC, whereas FTRS showed 59.09% sensitivity and 81.54% specificity. Also, TPS was found to be 75% accurate with 62.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for UTCC cases separately.ConclusionTPS 2.0 exhibits diagnostic accuracy with better performance in comparison to FTRS, making it a more reliable system for clinical practice. Our findings endorse the utility of TPS 2.0 in improving the accuracy of urine cytology in predicting histological diagnosis of HGUC.

AB  - Purpose Direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) has been the standard for aspiration thrombectomy (AT) in anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (AC-LVO) with modifications of the technique based on devices used and difficulties encountered. We introduce the ASCEND technique (Aspiration with Steam-shaped Catheter, Excluding additioNal Devices), and hypothesize that it improves catheter navigation, leading to time and cost savings in MT. Methods This is a single institute, retrospective, pre-post intervention study, including consecutive patients with AC-LVO who underwent AT as first-pass technique. Patients were divided into two groups based on the first-pass technique attempted (ASCEND vs conventional ADAPT). Baseline characteristics, primary outcomes (first pass time, total procedure time, total additional devices and device cost) and secondary outcomes (recanalization, complications) were compared between groups. Multiple linear regression models were built for primary outcomes to look for the effect of steam-shaping when covariates are present to reflect real-world setting. Multi-national survey performed to introduce the technique and feedback obtained. Results ASCEND (n = 39) and cADAPT (n = 40) groups were similar in baseline clinical characteristics. Anterior genu and ophthalmic segment were crossed in 94.9%, clot reached in 84.6%, and entire MT procedure completed in 59.0% of patients of the ASCEND group without use of additional materials. Groups were similar in performance and safety indicators. ASCEND technique was superior to conventional ADAPT with less first-pass time (8.9 vs 14.7 min), total procedure time (20.2 vs 35.4 min), additional devices used (0 vs 3) and cost involved (2083 vs 5830 ) pound per procedure (all P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression models maintained improved primary outcomes with steam-shaping (all P < 0.05). Neurointerventionalists who tried ASCEND (n = 11) affirmed that it was safe and likely to save time and cost involved. Conclusion ASCEND technique, involving a simple step of steam-shaping the aspiration catheter during MT can provide huge benefits in time and cost savings, without compromise of performance or safety.

AB  - Abdominopelvic paragangliomas are rare tumours and data on outcomes are scarce. We reviewed our 15-year experience of paraganglioma surgery for surgical outcomes, morbidity, and impact on health-related quality of life. In an IRB approved study, we reviewed our records of patients who underwent surgery for abdominopelvic paragangliomas between 2008 and 2022. Preoperative clinical parameters, operative details and complications were recorded. Patients were followed-up, either physically or telephonically, for symptom resolution, hospital admissions and current quality of life using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version score. Data was tested for normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and is reported with variance. We identified 30 patients, of whom 16 (55%) presented with the triad of headache, palpitations and sweating and 80% had hypertension. 76% tumors occurred in the para-aortic or inter aorto-caval location. Laparoscopic excision was performed in 18, robot-assisted laparoscopy in 3 and open surgery in 9 patients. Two laparoscopic procedures were converted to open surgery due to non-progress in dissection. No intraoperative complications occurred while 1 patient with chronic kidney disease required post-operative haemodialysis. Twenty-six patients were available for follow-up at a median of 79 months (range 4-128 months). All had resolution of symptoms; 92% became normotensive and among 8 patients with diabetes preoperatively, 7 did not require anti diabetic medication after surgery. No patient had any hypertensive episode requiring hospital re-admission. The quality of life in 18 patients who had a physical visit was satisfactory in all domains. Surgery for abdominopelvic paragangliomas through any approach is safe and results in excellent functional outcomes with resolution of hypertension and diabetes and a satisfactory overall quality of life.

AB  - Background and AimNon-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as ongoing symptoms despite 6-12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD), the only known treatment for celiac disease (CeD). There is inconsistency in studies describing the proportion of patients having NRCD and its various causes among patients with CeD. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and causes of NRCD.MethodsThe PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for original studies reporting the proportion of patients with persistent symptoms after >= 6 months of GFD. Studies reporting the etiologies of NRCD were also identified. The systematic review was conducted as per the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed in STATA.ResultsOf 2965 search results, nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five studies (n = 4414) reported data on prevalence, and seven studies (n = 790) reported the causes of NRCD. The pooled prevalence of NRCD was 22% (95% confidence interval, 11-35%). Among patients with NRCD, inadvertent exposure to gluten was the most common cause (33%), followed by functional gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome in 16%. Refractory CeD type II along with its premalignant and malignant sequelae was observed in 7% of patients with NRCD.ConclusionOne in five patients with CeD may not respond to GFD and would likely be classified as NRCD. Inadvertent gluten exposure was the cause of ongoing symptoms in one-third of patients with NRCD. Improving adherence to GFD along with developing novel therapeutics to mitigate symptoms due to ongoing gluten exposure is critical.

AB  - AimsIslet antibody-negative type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has not been well characterised. We determined the frequency of antibody-negative T1DM and compared it with antibody-positive T1DM in a cohort of north Indian children.MethodsIn a multi-centre, prospective, observational study, 176 Indian children (age 1-18 years) were assessed within 2 weeks of diagnosis of T1DM. Antibodies against GAD65 (GADA), islet antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A), were estimated using validated ELISA. HLA-DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 alleles were studied by Luminex-based typing. Monogenic diabetes was determined by targeted next-generation sequencing using the Illumina platform.ResultsAfter excluding 12 children with monogenic diabetes, GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A were present in 124 (76%), 60 (37%) and 62 (38%) o children, respectively, while 24 (15%) were negative for all antibodies. A single antibody (most frequently GADA) was present in 68 (41%) of children, while all three antibodies were found in 34 (21%). Islet antibody-negative T1DM (n = 24, 15%) did not differ from antibody-positive children in their clinical features, HbA1c or plasma C-peptide, both at onset or after 1 year follow-up (available in 62 children). The frequency of other organ-specific antibodies or high-risk HLA-DR and DQ alleles were also similar. Children with a single islet antibody did not differ from those with multiple antibodies.ConclusionsThe frequency of various islet-antibodies, in isolation and combination, differed considerably from studies among children of European descent with T1DM. Children with T1DM who were islet antibody-negative were indistinguishable from those who were antibody-positive.

AB  - BackgroundDespite extensive clinical documentation, few studies have explored the genetic basis of congenital pouch colon (CPC) which is crucial for early detection, personalized treatment, and genetic counselling.ObjectiveTo compile the information on the genetic basis of CPC and the functional enrichment of underlying molecular pathways.Materials and methodsThe review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The implicated genes were investigated for underlying molecular pathways. A network was subsequently created on String-database followed by gene-ontology analysis.ResultsThe study included 20 CPC cases and 52 controls (across 4 studies). Numerous variants, including 24 missense SNPs, 63 frameshift variants, and stop-gain/stop-loss mutations in 11 genes were identified. Notable genetic markers included MUC5B, FRG1, and TAF1B, with potential roles in mucosal barrier functions, colonic muscular development, and ribosomal RNA transcription, respectively. Copy number variants and lnc-EPB41-1-1 were also implicated. Genetic hotspots were identified on chromosomes 11, 17 and 16. RGPD2 and RGPD4, contributing to GTPase activator activity and known to be associated with bowel/colon, were differentially expressed. Pathway analysis highlighted Wnt and HOX pathways, with JAG1 and MLL relevant to CPC pathogenesis.ConclusionThe study integrates genetic evidence and pathway analysis, shedding light on the complex genetic architecture of CPC. While the importance of genetic markers in the etiopathogenesis of CPC is underscored, the need for validating the findings on larger cohorts, diverse populations and through functional studies is suggested.

AB  - During the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients experienced breathlessness, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to the need for supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. With each passing day, the need for medical oxygen increased and simultaneously medical oxygen reserves in the country were getting depleted. Government agencies deployed multipronged strategies to ensure that the hospitals had an adequate supply of medical oxygen. Mechanisms and formulae were devised for the rational allocation of medical oxygen to various regions in the country; the production of medical oxygen was boosted along with the curtailment of oxygen usage in industries; and efficient supply chain management, which included " Oxygen Express"- special trains for transporting oxygen, aircrafts for transporting medical oxygen, creating green corridors and real-time monitoring of oxygen levels using information technology. The usage and promotion of indigenous PSA oxygen technology augmented the medical oxygen generation capacity at the health care facility level. This emergency situation demonstrated a need for strengthening established intersectoral coordination mechanisms for swift and effective responses to similar situations in future. Various strategies adopted by the Central Government and other government agencies to a large extent helped in addressing the medical oxygen emergencies.

AB  - Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal types of Gliomas, and its treatment greatly depends on the stage of its detection. Galactin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) serves as a novel circulatory biomarker for detecting glioma at an early stage. This protein is also responsible for metastasis, proliferative signaling, angiogenesis, and immune system evasion in the case of brain tumors. Inhibition of LGALS3BP can help in the reduction of metastasis and progression of the disease. Currently, no effective drug is available that can completely treat glioma. In this study, we have virtually screened the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug databank to discover potential inhibitors of LGALS3BP. Based on the binding free energy calculations using MMPBSA, three compounds, 627861 (-16.69 kcal/mol), 329090 (-13.66 kcal/mol), and 627855 (-10.01 kcal/mol), were selected as potent inhibitors. 200 ns MD simulation studies further complemented this study. Finally, we recommend three molecules, 627861, 329090, and 627855, can be potential inhibitors of LGAL3SBP. The structural scaffolds of these molecules can also lead to the optimization of better inhibitors of LGALS3BP and be implicated in the therapeutic management of glioma after desired experimental validations.

AB  - Background and objectives: Tau PET is being increasingly appraised as a novel diagnostic modality for dementia work up. Given limited data among South Asians, we assessed the frequency, patterns, phenotypic associations and incremental value of positive Tau PET scans in clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative dementia. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited consecutive patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD syndromes (September 2021 to October 2022, India). Participants underwent clinical interview, cognitive assessment, MRI brain and tau PET scan ([F-18]ML-104). Visual read in a priori regions of interest was used to identify patterns of tau deposition in the brain. Results: We recruited 54 participants (mean age: 63.2 +/- 9.2 years, 64.8 % men, 77.8 % dementia, 70.4 % early onset cases, 37.8 % APOE4+). The analysis identified abnormal tau uptake in 40/54 (74.1 %) participants; with uptake in AD signature areas in 27/40 (67.5 %) cases [cortical subtype (74.1 %), limbic (14.8 %), combined cortical/limbic (11.1 %)], and patterns not conforming to AD in 13/40 (32.5 %) cases. Tau PET substantiated the diagnosis of AD among 17/19 (89.5 %) cases with clinically diagnosed AD dementia, 8/23 (34.8 %) cases with suspected non-AD cause, and 2/12 (16.7 %) cases with mild cognitive impairment. A trend for increasing proportion of early onset cases, and worsening cognition, behavior and functional ability was seen, from 'limbic' to 'combined cortical/limbic' to 'cortical' subgroups. Conclusion: Tau PET is a useful modality to differentiate AD dementia from other neurodegenerative causes in the Indian setting where amyloid biomarkers are not widely available. Biological subtypes of AD map well onto clinical phenotypes and need study in larger cohorts.

AB  - High-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (HGBCL, NOS) has overlapping morphological and genetic features with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), leading to uncertainty in its diagnosis and clinical management. Using functional genomic approaches, we previously characterized HGBCL and NOS, that demonstrate gene expression profiling (GEP), and genetic signatures similar to BL. Herein, we characterize distinct HGBCL, NOS, cohort (n = 55) in adults (n = 45) and in children (n = 10), and compared the GEP, genomic DNA copy number (CN), and mutational spectrum with de novo DLBCL (n = 85) and BL (n = 52). This subgroup, representing ~60% of HGBCL, NOS, lack gene-expression signature of BL and double hit/dark zone lymphoma, but express DLBCL like signatures and are characterized by either GCB- or ABC-like mRNA signatures and exhibit higher genomic complexity, similar to de novo DLBCL, and show alteration in genes regulating B-cell activation (CD79B, MYD88, PRDM1, TBLIXR1, CARD11), epigenome (KMT2D, TET2) and cell cycle transition (TP53, ASPM). However, recurrent mutations in genes often mutated in BL (DDX3X, GNA13, CCND3), but rare in DLBCL, are also present in HGBCL-NOS, highlighting genetic heterogeneity. Consistent with mutation spectrum, frequent genomic CN alterations in genes regulating B-cell activation (del-PRDM1, gain-BCL6, -REL, -STAT3) and cell cycle regulators (del-TP53, del-CDKN2A, del-RB1, gain-CCND3) were observed. Pediatric cases showed GCB-DLBCL-like mRNA signatures, but also featured hallmark mutations of pediatric BL. Frequent oncogenic PIM1 mutations were present in adult HGBCL, NOS. In vitro analyses with pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PIM1 expression triggered B-cell activation and NF-kappa B-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PIM1 is a rational therapeutic target.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a highly prevalent gut pathogen with reported implications in a wide range of gastrointestinal disorders. Antibiotic based therapy, especially with clarithromycin is one of most effective treatment strategies against H. pylori. However, rising global prevalence of clarithromycin resistance in certain H. pylori strains, primarily attributed to point mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA coding gene, pose a major challenge in effective eradication of this pathogen. There are a number of established methodologies devised for H. pylori mutation detection, so as to provide a tailored treatment plan to the patients and resist further transmissions of antibiotic resistant strains. However, there is no 'gold standard' method available to detect mutation status in clinical isolates of H. pylori from infected patients. CRISPR-Cas9 based technologies have revolutionized the field of mutation detection in biological samples, particularly during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Although multiple assays have been reported for detection of H. pylori in clinical samples including CRISPR diagnostics (CRISPRDx) platforms, there is no such assay reported till date to detect specific mutations that confer antibiotic resistance to this pathogen. In this study, we have developed an assay using engineered FnCas9 (en31-FnCas9) protein to effectively detect the A2142G and A2143G mutations in the 23S rDNA of H. pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsy samples. The data from in vitro cleavage assays and strip-based lateral flow tests using en31-FnCas9 and guide RNAs targeting the conserved and mutated loci of H. pylori 23S rDNA are in perfect congruence with the data from Sanger sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Our results indicate that en31-FnCas9 based mutation analysis can be deployed as an efficient diagnostic methodology to detect clarithromycin susceptibility in patients with suspected H. pylori infections.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesSovateltide (Tycamzzi (TM)), an endothelin-B (ET-B) receptor agonist, increases cerebral blood flow, has anti-apoptotic activity, and promotes neural repair following cerebral ischaemic stroke. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sovateltide in adult participants with acute cerebral ischaemic stroke.MethodsThis was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase III clinical trial of sovateltide in participants with cerebral ischaemic stroke receiving standard of care (SOC) in India. Patients aged 18-78 years presenting up to 24 h after the onset of symptoms with radiologic confirmation of ischaemic stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) of >= 6 were enrolled. Patients with recurrent stroke, receiving endovascular therapy, or with intracranial haemorrhage were excluded. The study drug (saline or sovateltide [0.3 mu g/kg] was administered intravenously in three doses at 3 +/- 1 h intervals on Days 1, 3, and 6, and follow-up was 90 days). The Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was used to impute the missing assessments on the endpoints. An unpaired t-test, two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test, and the Chi-square test were used for the statistical analysis. The objective was to determine at Day 90 (1) the number of patients with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) 0-2, and (2) the number of patients with an NIHSS 0-5 at 90 days.ResultsPatients were randomised with 80 patients in the sovateltide and 78 in the control group. Patients received the investigational drug at about 18 h of stroke onset in both control and sovateltide groups. The median NIHSS at randomisation was 10.00 (95% CI 9.99-11.65) in the control group and 9.00 (95% CI 9.11-10.46) in the sovateltide group. Seventy patients completed the 90-day follow-up in the control group and 67 in the sovateltide group. The proportion of intention-to-treat (ITT) patients with mRS 0-2 score at Day 90 post-randomisation was 22.67% higher (odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.37-5.57); similarly, the proportion of patients with NIHSS score of 0-5 at Day 90 was 17.05% more (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.27-5.90) in the sovateltide group than in the control group. An improvement of >= 2 points on the mRS was observed in 51.28% and 72.50% of patients in the control and sovateltide groups, respectively (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.29-4.81). Seven of 78 patients (8.97%) in the control group and 7 of 80 (8.75%) in the sovateltide group developed intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). The adverse events were not related to sovateltide.ConclusionsThe sovateltide group had a greater number of cerebral ischaemic stroke patients with lower mRS and NIHSS scores at 90 days post-treatment than the control group. This trial supported the regulatory approval of sovateltide in India, but a multinational RESPECT-ETB trial will be conducted for US approval.Trial RegistrationClinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2019/09/021373) and the United States National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04047563).

AB  - Purpose: Brain imaging is needed when investigating epilepsy. Imaging options available include MRI and CT scan which may be non-contrast (NCCT) or contrast-enhanced (CECT). The specific clinical question and probable epilepsy substrate in the epidemiological context and socioeconomic milieu are important in determining the choice of imaging. In patients with well-controlled focal or unknown epilepsy who are unlikely to be surgical candidates, is CECT essential or can NCCT be an acceptable choice? Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in India. Consecutive patients with focal or unknown epilepsy who were relatively well-controlled on medical treatment underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Three neuroradiologists independently reported the images. Proportion of abnormalities missed on NCCT and picked only on CECT were determined. How often abnormalities picked on CECT changed patient management was also analysed. Results: Two hundred and nineteen patients with focal (87 %) or unknown (13 %) epilepsy underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Most had epilepsy for >3 months and an annual seizure frequency of 2-10 seizures. There was a nearly perfect inter-observer agreement between 3 neuroradiologists in reporting the NCCT and CECT as 'normal' or 'abnormal' with kappa (kappa) values of 0.9 and 1.0 respectively. The sensitivity of NCCT compared to CECT in detecting an abnormality was 97 % (CI 92.6 - 99.5 %) and the specificity was 99 % (CI 94.9 - 99.9 %). There was no significant difference in the proportion of NCCTs and CECTs found abnormal (50.22 % vs 51.14 %, p = 0.91). A solitary calcified granuloma was the most common abnormality reported on NCCT as well as CECT, 21.0 % and 19.1 % respectively. New findings picked on CECT alone, did not change management in any patient. Conclusion: When imaging focal or unknown epilepsy, an NCCT performs as well as a CECT, especially in regions where calcified lesions contribute a significant etiological burden. The role of imaging in epilepsy varies between patients and a universal recommendation of an MRI or a CECT in all patients is neither cost-efficient nor evidence-based. In drug responsive focal or unknown epilepsy of longstanding duration, CT scans are either normal or have calcified lesions that are easily picked on NCCT.

KW  - Adhesiolysis
AB  - Iatrogenic injuries can result from a variety of medical interventions and procedures, ranging from surgical errors to adverse reactions to medications, but what is more important is that it has to be timely managed. This case report highlights the complication of subclavian artery injury following multiple attempts of central venous catheterization for total parenteral nutrition, where intensive monitoring, early evaluation with imaging, and timely intervention by multidisciplinary team approach rescued the patient from the catastrophic exsanguination at the level I trauma center. An 18-year-old gentleman, a follow-up case of low velocity penetrating torso trauma with right-sided cardiac, diaphragmatic, liver, and transverse colonic injury with class IV hemorrhagic shock, and undergone damage control surgery with primary repair of cardiac, diaphragmatic, and transverse colonic injury with perihepatic packing, was re-admitted with the clinical features of acute intestinal obstruction. He underwent emergency laparotomy and adhesiolysis. In the postoperative period, total parenteral nutrition supplementation was planned. Ultrasound-guided central line insertion via the right subclavian vein failed despite multiple attempts. Immediate post-procedure, his vital parameters were normal. But later, he developed clinical signs of hemorrhagic shock. Resuscitative measures started immediately as per the advanced trauma life support protocol. His contrast-enhanced computed tomography chest and angiographic studies showed the right subclavian artery injury with right-sided massive hemothorax with underlying lung collapse. Emergent endovascular stenting of the right subclavian artery, followed by emergency thoracotomy with evacuation of hemothorax, was done. The post-procedure course was uneventful.

AB  - Background: Despite the proven efficacy of telestroke in improving clinical outcomes by providing access to specialized expertise and allowing rapid expert hyperacute stroke management and decision-making, detailed operational evidence is scarce, especially for less developed or lower income regions.Aim: We aimed to map the global telestroke landscape and characterize existing networks.Methods: We employed a four-tiered approach to comprehensively identify telestroke networks, primarily involving engagement with national stroke experts, stroke societies, and international stroke authorities. A carefully designed questionnaire was then distributed to the leaders of all identified networks to assess these networks' structures, processes, and outcomes.Results: We identified 254 telestroke networks distributed across 67 countries. High-income countries (HICs) concentrated 175 (69%) of the networks. No evidence of telestroke services was found in 58 (30%) countries. From the identified networks, 88 (34%) completed the survey, being 61 (71%) located in HICs. Network setup was highly heterogeneous, ranging from 17 (22%) networks with more than 20 affiliated hospitals, providing thousands of annual consultations using purpose-built highly specialized technology, to 11 (13%) networks with fewer than 120 consultations annually using generic videoconferencing equipment. Real-time video and image transfer was employed in 64 (75%) networks, while 62 (74%) conducting quality monitoring. Most networks established in the past 3 years were located in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Conclusion: This comprehensive global survey of telestroke networks found significant variation in network coverage, setup, and technology use. Most services are in HICs, and a few services are in LMICs, although an emerging trend of new networks in these regions marks a pivotal moment in global telestroke care. The wide variation in quality monitoring practices across networks, with many failing to report key performance metrics, underscores the urgent need for standardized, resource-appropriate, quality assurance measures that can be adapted to diverse settings.

AB  - High pigmentation and the abundance of M2 macrophages have been identified as negative predictors in uveal melanoma (UM). Risk factors associated with UM that are prevalent in high-risk White populations are still present, although less common, in relatively low-risk Asian populations. Research indicates that proangiogenic M2 macrophages and monosomy 3 play significant roles in UM progression. Our aim was to investigate the impact of tumor- associated macrophages in UM and examine their correlation with monosomy 3 and pigmentation. Transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of macrophages in UM. Forty UM samples underwent fluorescent in situ hybridization for monosomy 3 identification. Immunohistochemis try was done to assess M2/M 1 macrophages on 82 UM tissue samples. IL-10 and IL-12 expressions were quantified in UM serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of all markers was correlated with pigmentation markers (tyrosinase-related protein 1, tyrosinase-related protein 2, silver protein, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor). Prognostic outcomes were determined using the Cox proportional hazard model and log-rank tests. Increased expression of M2/M 1 macrophages was observed in 31 UM cases, which correlated with the high expression of pigmentation markers. IL-10 concentration was high in UM cases. Monosomy 3 was evident in 50% of UM cases and significantly associated with increased immunoexpressi on of M2/M 1 macrophages and pigmentation markers. Reduced metastasis-free survival was observed in patients with UM with high M2/M 1 macrophage expression (P 1 / 4 .001). High pigmentation and increased M2 macrophage density could impact the tumor microenvironment in UM. This could contribute to ineffective antitumor immune responses in patients with UM. Our findings suggest avenues for developing novel therapeutic approaches to counteract these immunosuppressive effects in UM. (c) 2024 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesWrong blood in tube (WBIT) continues to be a preventable cause of unintended harm to the patient. The literature describing extent of the problem, its consequences and factors leading to WBIT from the perspective of lower middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. The present study describes WBIT and its outcome in a hospital-based blood centre from an LMIC.Materials and MethodsWBIT events occurring during the study period were analysed to identify the root cause. In addition, they were analysed according to discipline, department and time of sample draw. Root causes were divided and compared with standard operating procedure (SOP) for sample collection for blood requests. All WBIT events were followed and their outcomes analysed.ResultsWBIT events occurred at a rate of 4.8/10,000 blood requests, with a higher rate in urgent requests (5.2/10,000 requests). The average rate of WBIT was higher in surgical disciplines compared to medical and acute care services (6.58 vs. 4.43 vs. 3/10,000 requests). The highest rate of WBIT was observed when requests were received during 8:00 PM-2:00 AM (p = 0.02). Deviations from SOP with contribution from human and organizational elements were identified as the root cause. The consequences ranged from delay in providing blood to acute haemolytic transfusion reactions.ConclusionWe found that WBITs occurred at a rate comparable to that reported from developed countries. Use of software and automation may reduce the rate of WBIT but not eliminate it completely. Strict adherence to SOPs and continuous training of phlebotomy staff would help reduce it to a minimum. Blood centres need to develop specific strategies with respect to their root causes.

AB  - In this paper, we have developed a series of piperic acid (PA) derivatives to overcome the inherent constraints linked to PA for Alzheimer's disease (AD) management. We have carried out a comprehensive study to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of PAanalogs to enhance their inhibitory properties towards cholinesterase enzymes. Compound 3m exhibited notable inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) among all developed analogs (BChE (mu M), 1.03 +/- 0.011; AChE (mu M), 4.26 +/- 0.13 respectively) over PA (AChE% inhibition at 20 mu M, 7.14 +/- 0.98; BChE% inhibition at 20 mu M, 5.87 +/- 0.76). Compound 3m was chosen for further biological investigations based on these encouraging outcomes. 3 m demonstrated a binding affinity for AChE's peripheral anionic site, indicating its interaction with this specific enzyme region. Additionally, it also possesses favorable permeability across the blood-brain barrier, with a Pe (permeability coefficient) value of 5.79 +/- 1.12. The molecular docking investigations unveiled the ability of 3mto intricately engage with AChE and BChE.In cell-based cytotoxicity tests, compound 3m displayed cell-friendly characteristics across different tested concentrations. Notably, 3m exhibited the ability to counteract scopolamine-induced memory impairmentin mice, enhancing both spatial and cognitive memories. These results strongly suggest that 3m can behave as a potential compound for AD management.

AB  - Clinical relevanceAngle closure glaucoma is one of the most common blinding diseases encountered mainly in older age groups, although it may also occur at a younger age. Identifying the underlying cause of angle closure helps in designing specific treatment strategies essential for effective disease management.BackgroundPrimary angle closure disease, caused due to pupillary block (PB) and plateau iris configuration (PIC), necessitates different management strategies. This study assessed the potential utility of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and optical biometry in distinguishing PIC from PB in primary angle closure disease of the young (PACDy).MethodsPatients aged 20-40 years with PACDy and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Ophthalmic examinations included gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy, ASOCT, and biometry. Anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, axial length, central corneal thickness, lens position, relative lens position, vitreous cavity length, lens vault, relative lens vault and angle opening distance, trabecular iris space area, and trabecular iris angle were measured. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis evaluated the discriminative ability of these parameters.ResultsOf the 280 eyes, 128 were normal and 152 had PACDy. Of 128 PACDy, 88 had PIC, and 64 had PB. Both PIC and PB had significantly smaller ASOCT and biometric parameters than normal eyes. However, PIC had intermediate biometric values that fell between normal eyes and PB. All the aforementioned parameters, except central corneal thickness, showed excellent discriminating ability of PIC and PB from normal eyes; however, no single parameter can strongly differentiate PB from PIC. Axial length and relative lens vault had the highest, although weak, power for discriminating PB from PIC.ConclusionASOCT and biometry effectively distinguish PIC and PB from normal eyes, but no single parameter reliably differentiates PIC from PB. Comprehensive gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy may be necessary for accurate diagnosis in PACDy.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms associated with the characteristic NAB2::STAT6 gene fusion. They frequently occur in extra-thoracic sites and are not uncommon in the head and neck (HN) region. Myxoid SFT is a rare morphological subtype of SFT, the features of which overlap with those of other myxoid-appearing tumors, making the diagnosis challenging. We describe the distinctive histopathological and immunohistochemical features of myxoid SFT that occurred in a 32-year-old man with a recurrent swelling in the nasal vestibule. Histological examination showed a nodular tumor composed of short spindle-shaped cells in an abundant myxoid stroma. Nuclei were ovoid, with minimal pleomorphism. Occasional intervening slender vascular channels were present; staghorn vasculature was absent. Tumor cells were diffusely immunopositive for STAT6, CD34, and BCL2, while S100, SOX10, EMA, ER, and CD10 were negative, confirming the diagnosis of myxoid SFT. Thus, myxoid SFTs are unusual in the HN, with potential for misdiagnosis. Due to their propensity for local recurrence if incompletely excised, a high index of suspicion is required to include them in differential diagnosis of myxoid mesenchymal neoplasms occurring at this location. STAT6 is a reliable immunohistochemical marker that aids in diagnosis, reducing the necessity for molecular testing.

AB  - BackgroundThe Androgen Receptor (AR) has emerged as an endocrine therapy target in Breast Cancer, exhibiting up to 80% expression in clinical cases. AR-V7, a constitutively activated splice variant of AR with a truncated ligand-binding domain (LBD), demonstrates ligand-independent transcriptional activity and resistance to nonsteroidal antiandrogens like Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide, targeting the LBD. In metastatic prostate cancer, elevated AR-V7 levels lead to therapeutic resistance and increased metastasis.MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the expression of AR and AR-V7 in cell lines and a cohort of 89 patients undergoing surgical intervention for treatment-na & iuml;ve breast cancer. Further clinicopathological correlations and survival analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between the AR and AR-V7 expression and clinical outcomes.ResultsAR-V7/AR-FL ratio was elevated in the TNBC cell line and downregulation of AR-FL upon AR antagonists' treatment led to a compensatory increase in AR-V7. Clinical samples showed significantly elevated expression of AR and AR-V7 in tumors compared to control cases. Further clinicopathological correlation revealed aggressive clinical traits, higher pathological grades, and poor survival with AR-V7 expression.ConclusionsOur study unravels AR-V7 as a marker for poor clinical outcomes, predicting breast cancer aggressiveness, and encourages consideration of AR-V7 as a probable target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Study ObjectivesRapid growth in childhood predisposes to obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood. While obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is bidirectionally linked to obesity, its developmental origins are sparsely studied. We examined associations between postnatal growth and the risk of OSA in adulthood.MethodsWe included adults whose childhood anthropometric data was collected in the New Delhi Birth Cohort study. The risk of OSA was defined by the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) with and without the obesity criterion. Using logistic regression, we studied associations of OSA risk with conditional growth parameters, which are statistically independent measures of gain in height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), during infancy (0-2 years), early childhood (2-5 years), and late childhood (5-11 years).ResultsAmong 521 subjects (58.9% males) with a mean (SD) age of 40.9 (1.7) years, 30.9% had a high risk of OSA. On multivariate analysis, a high risk of OSA was associated with a higher conditional BMI in infancy (odds ratio: 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.57; p = 0.048) and early childhood (1.35; 1.07-1.69; p = 0.011). Higher risk of OSA was associated with greater conditional weight in early childhood (1.34; 1.06-1.68; p = 0.013). Using the modified BQ definition without obesity, adult risk of OSA was significantly associated with a higher adult BMI instead of childhood conditional BMIs.ConclusionsGreater gain in conditional BMI or weight in early childhood is associated with a high risk of OSA in middle age, which is mediated by a higher attained adult BMI.

AB  - Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death among women, with estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) overexpression playing a pivotal role in tumor growth and progression. This study aimed to identify novel ER alpha inhibitors from a library of 561 natural compounds using computational techniques, including virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Four promising candidates - Protopine, Sanguinarine, Pseudocoptisine, and Stylopine - were selected based on their high binding affinities and interactions with key ER alpha residues. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted over 500 nanoseconds revealed that Protopine and Sanguinarine exhibited more excellent stability with minimal fluctuations, suggesting strong and stable binding. In contrast, Pseudocoptisine and Stylopine showed higher flexibility, indicating less stable interactions. Binding free energy calculations further supported the potential of Protopine and Sanguinarine as ER alpha inhibitors, though their binding strength was slightly lower than that of the reference compound. These findings highlight Protopine and Sanguinarine as leading candidates for further investigation, and in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate their therapeutic potential in breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Introduction: We present a robust and up-to-date synthesis of evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and treat newborn infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Newborn infection prevention interventions included strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR), prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), clean birth kits (CBKs), chlorhexidine cleansing, topical emollients, and probiotic and synbiotic supplementation. Interventions to treat suspected neonatal infections included prophylactic systemic antifungal agents and community-based antibiotic delivery for possible serious bacterial infections (PSBIs). Methods: A descriptive review combining different methodological approaches was conducted. To provide the most suitable recommendations for real-world implementation, our analyses considered the impact of these interventions within three distinct health settings: facility, mixed, and community. Results: In facility settings, the strongest evidence supported the implementation of multimodal stewardship interventions for AMR reduction and device-associated infection prevention bundles for HAI prevention. Emollients in preterm newborns reduced the risk of invasive infection compared to routine skin care. Probiotics in preterm newborns reduced neonatal mortality, invasive infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) risks compared to standard care or placebo. There was insufficient evidence for synbiotics and prophylactic systemic antifungals in LMICs. In mixed settings, CBKs reduced neonatal mortality risk compared to standard care. In community settings, chlorhexidine umbilical cord cleansing reduced omphalitis risk compared to dry cord care. For the treatment of PSBIs, purely domiciliary-based antibiotic delivery reduced the risk of all-cause neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral. Conclusion: Strategies for preventing HAIs and reducing AMR in healthcare facilities should be multimodal, and strategy selection should consider the feasibility of integration within existing newborn care programs. Probiotics are effective for facility-based use in preterm newborns; however, the establishment of high-quality, cost-effective mass production of standardized formulations is needed. Chlorhexidine cord cleansing is effective in community settings to prevent omphalitis in contexts where unhygienic cord applications are prevalent. Community-based antibiotic delivery of simplified regimens for PSBIs is a safe alternative when hospital-based care in LMICs is not possible or is declined by parents. More randomized trial evidence is needed to establish the effectiveness of CBKs, emollients, synbiotics, and prophylactic systemic antifungals in LMICs.

AB  - Background and Aim: Celiac disease (CeD) is increasingly diagnosed but significant disparities exist in awareness, practices, resources, and legislation worldwide. We conducted a global online survey with CeD experts to assess this disparity internationally. Methods: A 55 questions survey encompassing nine domains relevant to CeD care (awareness, gluten-free [GF] foods availability/cost/quality, GF labeling, CeD dietician availability, insurance for CeD patients, medical training, research funding, patient support groups, and unmet needs) was generated and sent to CeD experts worldwide electronically. Countries were stratified based on per capita income as high-income (HIC) and lower-income countries (LIC) (including upper-middle-, lower-middle-, and low-income countries). Survey responses were summarized as a single score using principal component analysis. Results: Valid responses were obtained from 131(37.4%) [HIC: 71; LIC: 60] of contacted CeD experts from 63 countries. Compared with HIC, LIC experts perceived worse availability (HIC:80% vs LIC: 47%; P < 0.001), quality (52% vs 20%; P < 0.001), and legislation for labeling of GF foods (82% vs 37%; P < 0.001), with unfavorable reimbursement policies (27% vs 12%; P = 0.002), subsidies (32% vs 13%; P < 0.001), and insurance (76% vs 43%; P < 0.001) for CeD patients. LIC also lacked awareness about CeD among general physicians (69% vs 32%; P < 0.001), trained celiac dieticians (39% vs 12%; P = 0.002), and active CeD patient support groups (93% vs 50%; P < 0.001). All experts believed that GF foods were costly (94% vs 87%), frequently contaminated (27% vs 32%), and unfavorably taxed (97% and 93%). The experts agreed on key unmet needs and better research funding. Overall CeD preparedness score (median 58.3 vs 33.0; P < 0.001) was also associated with income. Conclusions: The present survey highlights the opinion of global experts on the challenges, opportunities, and preparedness related to CeD and differences worldwide by income.

AB  - Background Parents of children with differences of sex development (DSD) are known to suffer from psychological distress at the time of diagnosis and thereafter. We analyzed the prevalence of anxiety and depression in Indian parents of children with DSD and its associated risk factors, as well as their experiences, perceptions and expectations from the healthcare system.Methods This cross-sectional study included parents of children aged <= 6 years with atypical genitalia. Data was collected through face-to-face semi-structured interview using specially designed questionnaire. Depression and anxiety have been assessed using PHQ9 (Patient health questionnaire) and GAD-7 (Generalized anxiety disorder scale), respectively.Results The current mean age of the 43 children (46,XY=26, 46,XX=16 and chromosomal DSD=1) was 36.5 +/- 21.4 months with a median age of diagnosis of 5 months (range- 0-60 months). 68 parents (35 mothers and 33 fathers) were interviewed. The score was above the cut-off for clinically significant depression in 27.2 and 25.7 % of the fathers and mothers, respectively; and for clinically significant anxiety in 15.1 and 28.6 % of the fathers and mothers, respectively. The most significant factor associated with psychological distress was rearing a boy with lower EMS in fathers and lower literacy levels (with higher perception of stigma) in mothers. Absence of family support was associated with high levels of distress in both parents.Conclusions There is a high level of depression and anxiety amongst Indian parents of children born with atypical genitalia and requirement for psychological support and counseling.

AB  - BackgroundXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genodermatosis, characterized both by premature aging and significantly increased risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers at an early age. However, limited literature is available on the common histopathological subtypes of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in these patients.MethodsIn this ambispective case series, we recruited patients of XP who had either a currently present skin tumor or previously excised one, provided their histopathological sections were available. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in all the patients. The histopathological findings were recorded by two trained dermatopathologists.ResultsOf 22 recruited patients with XP, 12 patients had 41 BCCs, and 23 (56.09%) of them showed a high-risk histopathological subtype. Basosquamous carcinoma (10, 24.39%) was the most frequent high-risk tumor followed by infiltrative variant (7, 17.07%). Mixed-histopathological subtypes were noted in six (14.63%) cases, and all of them had a high-risk component. The low-risk subtypes included nodular (n = 17, 41.46%) and superficial BCC (1, 2.43%). Though a deep dermal involvement was seen in 27 (65.85%) lesions, none showed a perineural invasion or necrosis. Three (7.31%) lesions showed ulceration, while 10 (24.39%) showed presence of pigmentation.ConclusionsA frequent occurrence of high-risk basal cell carcinoma was noted in patients with XP-mandating creation of appropriate treatment and follow-up strategies in these patients.

AB  - Objectives: Deficiency of adenosine deaminase-2 (DADA2) is a monogenic disorder closely resembling PAN and can present to physicians across various specialties. Through this case series, we aimed to study and describe the clinical spectrum of and outcomes for Indian children with DADA2. Methods: The de-identified data from all participating centres were entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and the coordinating centre (All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi) screened the data for accuracy and completeness. Results: We enrolled 16 children (11 females) in the study; the mean (S.D.) age at the time of onset of symptoms for males and females was 46.2 (47) and 73.6 (50.4) months, respectively. The most common clinical features in this cohort were fever and rash in 80% of patients. More than half of the children, n (%) [8, (53%)] had a CNS stroke. The other clinical features were hypertension [5(33%)], anaemia [3 (20%)] and arthralgia/arthritis in 4 (26%). These children were managed with various immunomodulators: steroids [13, (86%)], anti-TNF agents [12, (80%)], CYC [2 (13%)] and MMF [3 (20%)]. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] duration of follow-up for this cohort was 17 (10, 29) months. Fourteen children achieved remission, and none had recurrent strokes after the initiation of anti-TNF drugs. Conclusion: DADA-2 closely resembles PAN; early age of onset and CNS stroke are striking differentiating features from classic PAN. Most children respond well to anti-TNF agents without serious adverse events being observed during short-term follow-up.

AB  - Intracholecystic papillary neoplasm (ICPN) is a relatively new disease entity with an incidence of 0.40 to 0.61% in all cholecystectomies. It is a rare non-invasive, premalignant entity. We are presenting one such rare case of ICPN in a mid-70 s gentleman who presented to the surgery outpatient department with complaints of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. The radiological imaging was highly suggestive of carcinoma gallbladder localized to the fundus, and the patient underwent open radical cholecystectomy. To our surprise, the histopathological examination was suggestive of intracholecystic papillary neoplasm. We have highlighted ICPN as the differential of carcinoma gallbladder and its importance in clinical practice and the fact that nearly 60% of patients with ICPN die of biliary tract cancer, typically long after the diagnosis of ICPN. This suggests that a field effect renders the remainder of the biliary tract at risk of carcinoma.

AB  - The objective was to modulate the resistance of a hand-held device, e.g., joystick, for customizing a rehabilitative therapeutic patient-centric virtual environment protocol. Two similar sets of springs (each set having three springs with graded rigidness) were customized to increase the handle-resistance. The springs were experimentally calibrated to determine individual spring-constant value. The amount of exerted force values during joystick movements were standardized in a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 15). Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to determine the variability among healthy subjects. Further, five (n = 5) patients with stroke were enrolled in this pilot study and performed three separate virtual reality sessions using different springs. Task-performance metrics, i.e., time to complete, trajectory smoothness, and relative error, were evaluated for each of the levels. The values of spring-constants as determined experimentally were found to be 1.34 x 10(3) +/- 16.1, 2.23 x 10(3) +/- 29.8, and 6.47 x 10(3) +/- 470.9 N/m for springs with increased rigidity, respectively. The mean force values for different joystick movements were observed to be increasing linearly with increasing spring-rigidity. The calculated CV <= 14% indicated the variability in the recorded force values of healthy subjects. Increased task-performance metrics and visual analog scale-fatigue scores for session 2 and 3 as compared to session1, indicated increasing task difficulty at session 2 and 3.

AB  - Introduction: There are limited data on the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors/diseases (diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) and their composite scores reflecting overall cardiovascular health among young (< 50 years old) married couples. Methods: We have an established longitudinal prospective cohort of postpartum women with a history of hyperglycemia [pre-existing diabetes (PED; n = 101), overt diabetes in pregnancy (ODiP; n = 92), gestational diabetes (GDM; n = 643)], and normoglycemia (n = 183) in pregnancy and their spouses (n = 819). In this study, we report data from baseline cross-sectional evaluation of these 819 young couples regarding the burden of cardiovascular risk factors/diseases, their concordance and associations. Results: The mean (SD) age was 33.5 (4.9) years for women and 36.9 (5.4) years for men, and the evaluation was performed at a median (IQR) postpartum interval of 30 (20-45) months. Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia were present in 25.0%, 6.9%, 25.6%, and 4.0% of women and 15.8%, 20.2%, 14.3%, and 8.2% of men, respectively. Among men, dysglycemia (diabetes/prediabetes) and adverse cardiovascular score (average/poor) showed a significant trend in progression according to the antenatal categories of their partner (highest in DIP, intermediate in GDM, and lowest in normoglycemia). The concordance was higher for adverse cardiovascular score (58.5%), overweight/obesity (48.7%), and dysglycemia (42.4%) compared to prehypertension/hypertension (29.2%) and hypercholesterolemia (8.2%). The odds ratios were significant for all associations evaluated, except for elevated blood pressure, being strongest (OR > 2.0) for overweight/obesity and adverse cardiovascular score. Conclusions: Nearly three in five young couples evaluated in the study showed concordance for adverse cardiovascular scores. The cardiovascular risk in men increased in a graded manner across the increasing severity of antenatal glycemic categories of their partners.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for cancer signalling pathways and tumour maintenance, making ROS targeting a promising anti-cancer strategy. Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) has been shown to be effective against various cancers, but its impact on retinoblastoma, alone or with trolox, remains unreported. Cytotoxicity of CoQ(10) alone and with trolox was evaluated in normal human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and Y79 retinoblastoma cells using CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis, cell cycle, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Anti-angiogenic potential was tested using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted via RT-PCR and western blotting. CoQ(10), alone and with trolox, reduced Y79 cell viability, induced apoptosis through excess ROS generation, and decreased MMP significantly. Both treatments caused G2/M phase cell arrest. The CAM assay showed a significant reduction in endothelial cell proliferation, evidenced by fewer number of co-cultured HUVECs when exposed to CoQ(10) or CoQ(10) with trolox. The combination of CoQ(10) and trolox significantly reduced VEGF-A, ERK, and Akt receptor levels, while CoQ(10) alone significantly inhibited ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Together, CoQ(10 )and trolox reduced protein expression of VEGFA. CoQ(10) alone and with trolox, induces apoptosis in Y79 retinoblastoma cells by inhibiting the ERK/Akt pathway and downregulating VEGFA. This study is the first to report the in vitro and in-ovo anti-cancer potential of CoQ(10) alone or when combined with trolox, on human retinoblastoma Y79 cells.

AB  - Purpose: Telemedicine was widely adopted for epilepsy care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its role extends beyond preventing disease transmission, offering an efficient and high-quality care alternative. To understand the global scenario, an international group conducted a survey comparing telemedicine practices in epilepsy care before, during, and after the pandemic. Methods: The survey included 26 questions on demographics, telemedicine use for epilepsy care, regulations, reimbursement mechanisms, and tools used. Responses were collected via an online survey platform from June to October 2023. Results: Two hundred eighty-five respondents from 60 countries participated. The average telemedicine use in daily practice was 0 %, 0-10 % (median, IQR) before the pandemic, 65 %, 30-90 % during the pandemic, and 20 %,10-50 % after the COVID pandemic. Female respondents reported higher telemedicine use than males after the pandemic (25 %, 10-50 % vs 15 %, 5 %-30 %, p = 0.002). According to respondents' perceptions, post-pandemic telemedicine regulations flexibilities were reported as expanded by 36.8 %, restricted by 17.2 %, and unchanged by 46 %. Reimbursement for telemedicine increased during the pandemic but decreased afterward (Cochran's Q test, p < 0.001). Voice calls were the most used telemedicine platform (46.6 %). Privacy issues were reported by 49 respondents (18.3 %). Conclusion: Telemedicine use for epilepsy care increased during the pandemic and remained higher than pre- pandemic levels. However, improvements are needed in telemedicine applications, regulations, reimbursement, and patient privacy. International collaboration and experience sharing can enhance telemedicine's acceptance and practice globally.

AB  - Background/aims Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical presentations but diverging etiologies. The study aims to decipher CD and ITB-associated gut dysbiosis signatures and identify disease-associated co-occurring modules to evaluate whether this dysbiosis signature is a disease-specific trait or is a shared feature across diseases of diverging etiologies.
   Methods Disease-associated gut microbial modules were identified using statistical machine learning and co-abundance network analysis in controls, CD and ITB patients recruited as part of this study. Module reproducibility was reinvestigated through meta-network analysis encompassing >5400 bacteriomes and similar to 900 mycobiomes. Subsequently, >1600 Indian gut microbiomes were analyzed to identify a central-core gut microbiome of 46 taxa, whose abundances aided in the formulation of an India-specific Core Gut Microbiome Score (CGMS) to measure the degree of core retention.
   Results Both diseases witness similar patterns of alterations in [alpha]-diversity, characterized by a significant reduction in gut bacterial (i.e., bacterial/archaeal) diversity and a concomitant increase in the fungal [alpha]-diversity. Specific bacterial taxa, along with the diverging mycobiome enabled distinction between the diseases. Co-abundance network analysis of these taxa, validated by integrated meta-network analysis, revealed a 'disease-depleted' module, consistent across multiple cohorts, with >75% of this module constituting the central-core Indian gut microbiome. CGMS robustly assessed the core-microbiome loss across different stages of gut inflammatory disorders, in Indian and international cohorts.
   Conclusions While the disease-specific gain of detrimental bacteria forms an important component of gut dysbiosis, loss of the core microbiome is a shared phenomenon contributing to various GI disorders.

AB  - Bacteria possess hair-like projections on their surface termed pili. The primary function of a pilus is to enable bacterial cell attachment to the host. Since pili are associated with cell adhesion, they play a major role in bacterial colonization and infection. Due to their important functional role, these surface appendages become ideal drug targets, hence it is essential to study the mechanism associated with pilus assembly, elongation, and attachment. Several enzymes are required for pilus biosynthesis, and their adhesion to the host. In this review paper, we have described the importance of the Sortase C (SrtC) protein which is required for pilus assembly and pilin polymerization. We also provide a detailed structural comparison of the protein from various pathogenic bacteria and highlight the importance of SrtC as a drug target. In addition to this, we have also reported structural studies of SrtC from the pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus faecalis using homology modelling.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of ureteral diameter ratio (UDR) as a tool to prognosticate and manage vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Four scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria were all studies in which UDR was used in prognostication and/or management of VUR. An independent assessment of the methodological quality was performed by two authors using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality scale. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Thirteen studies (all retrospective) were included in this review. Pooling the data demonstrated a significantly lower UDR in the spontaneous resolution vs. persistence of VUR group (p = 0.001). Also, the pooled data showed significantly higher values of UDR in the breakthrough UTI group (p < 0.00001), those requiring operative intervention (p = 0.03), and those with persistence of VUR after endoscopic treatment (p < 0.0001). The estimated heterogeneity for two outcomes, i.e., spontaneous resolution and requirement of operative intervention in VUR were substantial and statistically significant. All except one of the included studies were of good methodological quality. However, further studies are required to identify the cut-off values for these respective outcomes.

AB  - BackgroundThe steep increase in knee arthroplasties in lower- and middle-income countries has increased demand for personalised rehabilitation care. Technology-based rehabilitation programs offer potential to replace or augment conventional face-to-face rehabilitation for providing continuum of care. We aimed to systematically develop a theory, evidence-driven, contextualised, and user-centred mobile health platform for people undergoing knee arthroplasty to facilitate monitoring progress during rehabilitation.MethodsWe followed the UK Medical Research Council's framework and adopted a behaviour design thinking approach, consisting of five steps; (1) conduct multiple literature reviews and cross-sectional surveys to determine the needs and problems experienced during the rehabilitation phase by healthcare professionals and individuals with replaced knees, (2) identify target behaviours along with barriers and facilitators, integrated within the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework, (3) identify intervention functions and components, behaviour change techniques, and features for the mobile application, selected after discussions with orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and behavioural experts, (4) develop a prototype application for end-users, and a web-based platform for healthcare professionals, and (5) pilot test the intervention for end-users' feedback on usability of the application and to identify possible strategies for implementing the intervention package.ResultsUsing the COM-B model, education, training, persuasion, enablement, and modelling were chosen as intervention functions for improving adherence to exercise protocol during early-phase of rehabilitation. The application featured five interlinked components; education, training, goal setting and self-management, communication, and a personalized therapy plan utilising 13 behaviour change techniques. An education booklet, exercise videos, text messaging, video consultation, and a digital tool for measuring range of motion were incorporated into the application. Feedback on the interactive prototype and education material was sought from ten patient volunteers and a physiotherapist. Pilot testing in a convenient sample with broad eligibility criteria (n = 30) indicated importance of digital literacy and dedicated time for remote consultation by healthcare provider within the existing clinical work. Overall, the intervention was well received and valued by the end users.ConclusionThis paper demonstrates the development of a contextualised digital behavioural intervention grounded in behavioural theory and evidence from literature to improve end-user's engagement with rehabilitation protocols after knee arthroplasty in lower- and middle-income country context.Trial registrationStudy registered prospectively (on 16 February 2023) at Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2023/02/049792).

AB  - AimsTo offer insights into various salient substance use and addictive behaviours related aspects as applicable to India.MethodsWe synthesised the published literature on addictive disorders from India. While not a systematic review of all available literature, the synthesis captures relevant themes including salient epidemiological findings, issues related to the prevention and management services targeted at addictive disorders, key observations in the context of the state of addiction science in the country, the policy status and its implications for the country.ResultsIn general, the prevalence of substance use in India seems to be lower compared with global averages. For opioids, the prevalence rate is higher than the global average. Addiction prevention and treatment options for persons with addictive disorders in India can be best described as 'diverse': there is a wide range of services available, which vary across settings. Some models, services and products aimed at prevention and treatment of addictive disorders have been developed in the country. The policy, regulatory framework and programs targeted at addictions are not entirely in sync with the science. India has a substantial body of addiction science research.ConclusionsThe addiction landscape in India is complex and evolving. There is a heterogeneity not only across the different themes related to addiction, but also within the themes across different parts of the country.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to determine the utility of prophylactic antibiotics before pyloromyotomy for the prevention of Surgical Site Infections (SSI) among children with Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS).MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed to identify papers published till 30th July 2024. The main outcome of interest was the incidence of SSIs. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random effects model. The I2 statistic was used to calculate the heterogeneity. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale (NOS) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.ResultsFive studies, published between 1999 and 2024, were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of developing SSI among those treated was RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.78, with I2 = 0%, indicating no incremental benefit of administration of prophylactic antibiotics. A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the database studies. Results from this analysis (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.20, I2 = 0%) demonstrated that no significant difference was observed after excluding studies with large sample sizes. All included studies were of good methodological quality as assessed with the NOS.ConclusionThe findings of this review demonstrate no incremental benefit of the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before pyloromyotomy in preventing SSIs in children with IHPS. However, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials need to be conducted in the future before any definite conclusions are drawn in this regard.

AB  - Sodium valproate is used for the management of seizures, status epilepticus, chronic pain syndrome, bipolar, and other affective disorders. Even with an acceptable safety profile, severe idiosyncratic reactions can occur with valproate use. A rare, serious, and life-threatening side effect of valproate is valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE). We intend to analyze the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment options, and outcome of VHE in neurosurgical patients and review the pertinent literature on this rare sequelae. We retrospectively reviewed patients who developed VHE following valproate use, either for the treatment of epilepsy or for seizure prophylaxis in our centre. We analyzed the demographic details, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. A total of four patients with a mean age of 26.3 +/- 5.1 (range 19 - 32 years). Valproate was prescribed for primary seizure prophylaxis in 2 patients (50%). The commonest etiology for valproate prescription was for brain tumors (3, 75%) followed by drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) (1, 25%). None of the patients were documented to have urea cycle disorder. The mean daily prescribed dosage of valproate was 1250 +/- 559 mg and the mean duration of administration was 13 +/- 13.3 months (range 4 months - 36 months). The mean serum NH3 level was 136,5 +/- 44.2 mu mol/L (range 107 - 212.8) and all patients (4, 100%) had hyperammonemia with a mortality rate of 50% (2 patients). The hyperammonemia was treated by stopping the valproate use (4, 100%) and dialysis (2, 50%). Normalization of ammonia levels led to clinical improvement in 50% (2 patients). Neurological deterioration in the postoperative period is a diagnostic challenge. VHE is a rare and life-threatening sequelae of Valproate-associated Hyperammonemia (VAH) in neurosurgical patients. A high index of suspicion is required due to its ambiguous presentation. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can change the course of this life-threatening sequelae.

AB  - Objective: The family is a fundamental unit of society and provides care to the needs of its members. This study aims to assess the independent contributions of nuclear and extended families through direct and indirect pathways towards the risk of early childhood caries among 5-year-old children from low socio-economic status families in Central India. Methods: Cross-sectional study with two-stage sampling of 313 randomly selected school children. The American Association of Pediatric Dentistry criteria were used for diagnosing early childhood caries (ECC) and severe early childhood caries (S-ECC). It was hypothesised that the type of family would impact ECC and S-ECC by acting on individual-level variables such as frequency of cleaning teeth, dietary patterns, and utilisation of dental services. Examiner-administered interviews collected information about demographic details and oral hygiene practices. Generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) examined the relationship between exogenous variables, including nuclear and extended families with ECC and SECC. Path coefficients and the standard error with a 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: ECC and SECC were present among 186 (59.4%) and 47 (15%) children. Nuclear families, more frequent between meal sugar consumption and lower utilization of dental care were associated with ECC (odds ratios of 2.43, 2.78, and 8.65, respectively (p< 0.001)). Nuclear families were also associated with SECC. Type of family directly (p< 0.001) and indirectly (p< 0.05) predicted ECC via three or more times sugar consumption and lower utilization of dental services. Conclusions: Nuclear families were associated with ECC and SECC among children. Health professionals need to understand the influence of the type of family and the associated pathway to tackle and reduce the burden of ECC.

AB  - BackgroundVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease primarily affecting Brazil, East Africa, and India, with India accounting for 18% of the global burden. While VL typically presents with systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, and splenomegaly, it can occasionally manifest atypically, posing significant diagnostic challenges. Neurological presentations of VL are extremely rare, making them difficult to suspect and diagnose. Cases where VL predominantly presents with neurological symptoms are particularly novel, underscoring the need for heightened awareness of such atypical manifestations in endemic regions.Clinical caseA 38-year-old man with history of recurrent atypical VL presented with diffuse lower back pain, progressive tingling, numbness, weakness in the lower extremities, and double vision for one month. Clinical and radiological evaluations suggested cauda equina syndrome and cranial nerve palsy, accompanied by generalized lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules, and skin papules. The differential diagnosis initially included disseminated tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and lymphoma. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an inflammatory syndrome. Histopathology of lymph node and bone marrow revealed Leishmania amastigotes and subcutaneous nodule and skin biopsy revealed inflammatory cells with granulomas. Furthermore, the qPCR test on DNA from a subcutaneous nodule, lymph node, and CSF was positive for Leishmania kinetoplast DNA. The species was further confirmed as Leishmania donovani through ITS-based PCR amplification and sequencing. Finally, a diagnosis of relapse of VL with lymph node, cutaneous, and neurological involvement, including abducens nerve palsy and cauda equina syndrome, was established. He was treated with combination of liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, along with intrathecal hyaluronidase, resulting in significant improvement.ConclusionUnlike previously reported cases with both systemic and neurological symptoms, our patient predominantly presented with neurological manifestations, making this a unique and novel presentation of VL. This case highlights diagnostic challenges and management of atypical VL, emphasizing neurological involvement and successful therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: The optimal duration of spontaneous breath trial (SBT) for patients with difficult extubation from mechanical ventilation is unknown. Objective: This study compared extubation success with two different durations of SBT in patients who failed their first SBT. Methods: This single-center randomized controlled trial included adults on mechanical ventilation who had failed their first SBT. The participants were randomized to receive pressure support ventilation (PSV) for either 30 or 120 min. Our primary outcome was the rate of successful extubation (without reintubation within 48 h). Key secondary outcomes were the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Results: A total of 119 patients (62.2 % male) with a mean age of 53.9 years were randomized to undergo SBT for either 30 min (n = 60) or 120 min (n = 59). Among them, 82.4 % of patients had hypercapnic respiratory failure. The rates of successful extubation were similar with SBT of 30 min and 120 min (58.3 % vs. 59.3 %, respectively; p = 0.91). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the durations of ICU and hospital stay or in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Conclusions: Extubation success and other clinically important outcomes were comparable between short (30 min) and long (120 min) SBT in difficult weaning. A 30-minute SBT may be acceptable in this setting.

AB  - Aims This study was undertaken to compare and expand the clinicopathological characteristics of SMARCA4-deficient thoracic undifferentiated tumour (SMARCA4-dUT) and switch/sucrose non-fermentable-deficient non-small cell lung carcinomas (SWI/SNF-dNSCLC) and to address cases with intermediate features. Methods The pathology department archive was searched for all primary mediastinal, pleural and lung-based malignancies that showed aberrant expression of two SWI/SNF proteins the Brahma (BRM) aka SMARCA2 and/or (Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) aka SMARCA4. Patient demographics, treatment and clinical outcomes were collected from records and telephonic interviews. Differences in histopathological features and immunohistochemical stains were analysed. Cases with characteristics intermediate between both tumour entities were sequenced to advance our understanding of their biology and to assign them a more accurate classification. Results We identified 50 tumours with SMARCA4 and/or SMARCA2 deficiencies, including 23 (46%) SMARCA4-dUT, 18 (36%) SMARCA4-dNSCLC and 2 (4%) SMARCA2-dNSCLC. Dyscohesive or undifferentiated cellular morphology versus frank gland formation along with keratin, claudin-4 and expression of >1 stem cell marker helped classify the SWI/SNF deficient tumours as SMARCA4-dUT or SWI/SNF-dNSCLC (p<0.05). Seven (14%) cases with BRG1 deficiency displayed 'intermediate' features of both SMARCA4-dNSCLC and SMARCA4-dUT and had the shortest overall survival. The smoking-related gene signature was observed on sequencing in all four cases examined. Conclusion Tumours with intermediate features between SMARCA4-dUT and SWI/SNF-dNSCLC exist and portend an equally poor prognoses. Immunostains, including keratin, claudin-4, TTF1, HepPar1, stem cell markers, along with BRG1 and BRM testing, are essential adjuncts to morphology, while molecular studies can offer supplementary evidence in challenging cases.

AB  - BackgroundCoeliac disease (CD) is common in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but prevalence varies globally due to differing screening protocols. There have been substantial changes in screening guidelines over the past two decades.AimTo evaluate CD prevalence in patients with T1D, focusing on screening studies using antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus for studies published up to 11 December 2023 using keywords related to CD and diabetes. We used random-effects models for overall prevalence and all subgroups, with heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic performed in STATA 18.ResultsWe included 106 articles involving 65,102 T1D patients across 40 countries. The pooled CD seroprevalence and confirmed CD prevalence were 9% (95% confidence interval, CI, 8%-10%) and 6% (95% CI 5%-7%), respectively. The prevalence was higher in females and children. Denmark, Saudi Arabia and Libya exhibited the highest prevalence (11%), followed by India and Egypt (10%). Belgium, France, Germany, South Africa and the United States had the lowest prevalence (2%). High-income countries showed significantly a lower CD prevalence than middle-income countries (p = 0.03). Meta-regression based on the Human Development Index (HDI) indicated that countries with higher HDI have lower seroprevalence and confirmed CD prevalence.ConclusionApproximately 1 in 16 patients globally and 1 in 12 patients in Asia and the Middle East with T1D has CD. We suggest that all patients with T1D should be screened for CD.

AB  - Importance Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Objective To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength. Evidence Review This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches. Findings A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation. Conclusions and Relevance In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a well-known member of the PPAR family and a potential target for the treatment of various disorders. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of various 6-aryl-4-sec.amino-2-oxo-2H-pyran-3-carbonitrile derivatives and functionalized thieno[3,2-c]pyran-2-ones, derived from ketene dithioacetal. Then all the synthesized compounds were docked for their activity as PPAR-gamma to predict the binding mechanism and affinities regarding rosiglitazone and muraglitazar. Our studies revealed that three compounds 10 e, 10 f, and 10 h showed significant binding affinities, with energy ranges comparable to standard drugs rosiglitazone and muraglitazar. The docking conformation studies revealed that the selected compounds nicely interact with PPAR-gamma in the ligand binding domain with positive predictive values. We also performed molecular dynamics of the most potent compounds to validate the result. Our results indicate that these novel compounds are potential PPAR-gamma ligands, offering new possibilities for therapeutic applications. This study underscores the potential of these synthesized compounds in the development of novel PPAR-gamma agonists.

AB  - A fifteen-year-old boy was brought to emergency department with complaints of altered sensorium, aphasia and right sided hemiparesis following severe dengue one month back. On physical examination, tone was flaccid and power was diminished in right upper and lower limbs. Reflexes were diminished in all four limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple well defined thin walled ring-enhancing lesions in left basal ganglia, bilateral cerebellum, left occipital lobe and bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal lobes. The basal ganglia focus was tapped. Potassium hydroxide-calcofluor white mount of the intra-operative pus sample showed fragmented septate hyphae with folding and with wide variations in breadth. A provisional report of septate and aseptate hyphae suggestive of mixed infection was given. Empirical voriconazole was stopped and the patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B to cover a broader spectrum of molds. Subsequently, fungal culture of the pus sample grew off-white glabrous colonies in multiple culture tubes. On lactophenol cotton blue mount, shield cells were seen suggestive of Cladosporium spp. Amphotericin B was stopped after provisional identification of Cladosporium spp. was given by the laboratory and IV voriconazole was started. The identification was confirmed to be Cladosporium cladosporioides by microculture and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the 18s ribosomal DNA. The patient improved with drainage of the largest basal ganglia focus and voriconazole. This case exemplifies the potential of saprobic fungi to cause invasive infections in human.

AB  - Background: Sustained activation of default mode network has been implicated for momentary lapses of attention and higher errors during performance of cognitive tasks in attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) children. Despite emerging evidence indicating the genetic basis of ADHD, there is paucity of literature investigating the alteration of DMN in children with ADHD and their unaffected siblings. Aim: To study the cortical sources of DMN in children with ADHD compared to their siblings and neurotypical controls. Methods: Eighty-six participants (35 ADHD (12.4(+2.7) years), 16 unaffected siblings (11.8(+4.3) years) and 35 matched neurotypical controls (12.6 (+3.6) years) participated in the study. 128 channel EEG data was acquired during rest and Stroop cognitive task and analyzed for cortical source estimation using LORETA software. Results: Higher activation of DMN and DMN associated areas were observed during encoding of the color-word stimuli in children with ADHD. Sustained activation of core DMN areas namely medial frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule was observed across all groups. Among the three groups, distinct cortical source activation differences were identified solely in the DMN and its associated areas among children with ADHD during the task encoding phase compared to baseline. In contrast, both siblings and neurotypical controls displayed activation in fronto-parieto-temporal areas subserving executive function were also observed. Conclusion: Sustained activity of DMN areas with minimal activity in executive network in ADHD children and unaffected siblings during encoding of stimulus implies potential endophenotypic marker in children with ADHD compared to neurotypical controls.

AB  - Due to numerous characteristics (chemical stability, optical transparency, etc.), tissue equivalency, and other factors, lithium borates are an appropriate material for radiation dosimetry. This work explores the optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimetry of lithium triborate (LiB3O5) doped with Ag. Here, we have used thermally-assisted OSL (TA-OSL), where OSL is recorded following thermal stimulation of the sample, to assess the presence of primary dosimetric and deep defects. The optimized elevated temperature for LiB3O5:Ag was found to be 100 degrees C corresponding to maximum TA-OSL intensity due to depletion of its filled traps (indicating deep defects). X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry were all used to characterized the structural and chemical properties of the sample. Along with other OSL characteristics like fading and repeatability, response of the obtained nanophosphor under CW-OSL with x-ray photons and electrons of a range of energies including cobalt-60 in radiotherapy has also been examined.

KW  - WOMEN
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate a commercial a Congo Red urine devise for assessing preeclampsia risk. Study design: Prospective non-intervention study among women presenting with clinical suspicion of preeclampsia. The devise was used at the time of enrolment and, depending on gestation, on 1-3 later occasions. Outcome measures: Abnormal diffusion patterns classified as positive or negative, in relation to subsequent confirmation of preeclampsia (detection and false- positive rates, and predictive value) and the probability of diagnosis within a fixed time period (rule-in and rule-out). Results: 600 women were enrolled in the study and follow-up information was available on 538, of whom 95 had preeclampsia at delivery and 443 did not. At enrolment the detection rate was 18 % and the false-positive rate 3.2 %; positive predictive value - probability of positive result being associated with preeclampsia - was 55 % and negative predictive value - probability of negative result not being preeclampsia - was 85 %. A positive test ruled-in delivery with preeclampsia within 28 days among 35 % and ruled-out preeclampsia with 7 days among 98 %. Repeat testing after enrolment yielded similar results to the initial sample. Conclusion: The test has screening potential although published studies differ in the observed detection rate. Using the test to rule-out preeclampsia within 7 days can provide a significant management advantage especially for triaging patients and selecting those who can be managed at the peripheral centres.

AB  - Traumatic dental injuries of permanent teeth result in multiple immediate and long-term consequences depending upon the severity of trauma, age of the patient, the status of root maturity, and the emergency care provided. The healing responses may get disturbed due to severe damage, loss of vascularity of the supporting structures, and infections. As a result, the prohealing mediators and pathways are overpowered by the destructive stimuli often manifested by an increased osteoclastic activity. Among the various late complications, the apical periodontitis or the periapical lesions are most worrisome for the patients and create clinical dilemma for the dentists. In the past, many such lesions were classified as cysts and subjected to surgical management. However, better understanding of lesion pathophysiology, three-dimensional imaging, and molecular pathways have established their inflammatory nature. The advancements in materials such as calcium silicates, and regenerative techniques have propelled the research related to non-surgical endodontic management as its clinical acceptability. The treatment largely follows the recommendations of regenerative medicine and is based on four principles: (a) establishing the drainage or an endodontic access to the area, (b) removal of most of the triggering agents such as necrosed pulp, toxins, and inflammatory mediators, (c) disinfection of the area, controlling inflammation and reversal of the acidic pH, and (d) maintenance of this infection/inflammation-free state for a long time through adequate sealing. This review aims to highlight the rationale of the approach, case selection, pathophysiology of the causation and healing, clinical protocols, and the limitations of non-surgical endodontic management of large periapical lesions secondary to traumatic dental injuries.

AB  - BackgroundThe prognosis of an avulsed permanent tooth depends on the time elapsed from injury to replantation in the injured socket. Wide variability exists in the terminologies used to describe this period. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify and categorize the terminologies related to this aspect of tooth avulsion, grade the explanations provided by the authors, and develop a consensus about the most appropriate terminology through a Delphi approach.MethodsThis study involved a scoping review to identify and analyze the terminologies. It was performed according to PRISMA-ScR with a systematic search performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, LILACS, and Web of Science. The terminologies were extracted, categorized, and evaluated for correctness. On the basis of the results of the review and expert group discussion, an ideal terminology was proposed. A Delphi study with 20 global experts in dental traumatology was conducted to develop a consensus for the proposed terminology and its description.ResultsA total of 92 studies were included. They were distributed into five categories according to the terminology used: (a) dry period alone, (b) total period with dry and/or wet times, (c) extra-alveolar period, (d) extraoral period, and (e) miscellaneous. The explanations provided were correct in 37.5% of the studies that used an extraoral period. In the Delphi study, the lowest scores were given to the term dry period. There was an agreement of 95% for the proposed terminology.ConclusionA wide variation in terminologies was observed that could be distributed into five categories. The correctness of explanations was highest in the studies that described total periods with dry and wet times. The Delphi study revealed excellent agreement for the proposed term "total extra-alveolar period," with precise and clear recordings of both nonphysiologic (dry) periods and physiologic (wet) periods.

AB  - Purpose: A comprehensive operative report for cancer surgery is crucial for accurate disease staging, risk stratification, and therapy escalation/de-escalation, which affects the outcome. Narrative operative reports may fail to include some critical findings. Furthermore, standardized operative reports can form the basis of a local registry, which is often lacking in limited-resource settings (LRSs). In adult literature, synoptic operative reports (SOR) contain more key findings than narrative operative reports. In the LRSs, where the capacity of diagnostic pathology services is typically suboptimal, the value of a thorough operative report is even greater. The aim of this study was to develop a SOR template to help standardize childhood cancer surgery reporting in LRSs.
   Methods: Twenty-three experts in pediatric cancer with extensive experience practicing in LRSs were invited to participate in a modified Delphi procedure. SOR domains for pediatric oncology surgery were drafted based on a literature search and then modified based on experts' opinions. The experts anonymously answered multiple rounds of online questionnaires until all domains and subdomains reached a consensus, which was predefined as 70% agreement.
   Results: Sixteen experts participated in the study, and two rounds of the survey were completed. Twenty-one domains were considered relevant, including demographics, diagnosis, primary site, preoperative disease stage, previous tumor biopsy or surgery, preoperative tumor rupture, neoadjuvant therapy, surgical access, type of resection, completeness of resection, tumor margin assessment, locoregional tumor extension, organ resection, intraoperative tumor spillage, vascular involvement, lymph node sampling, estimated blood loss, intraoperative complications and interventions to address them, specimen names, and specimen orientation.
   Conclusion: We developed a SOR template for pediatric oncology surgery in LRSs. Consensus for all 21 domains and associated subdomains was achieved using a modified Delphi procedure.

AB  - Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, which is a significant global health concern. The virulence mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity are multifaceted and complex. However, endocytic processes and motility are well accepted virulence determinants. As previously reported, an AGCK family kinase, EhAGCK1 to be involved in trogocytosis exclusively while another one from same family named EhAGCK2 participates in all actin dependent endocytic processes. As the kinase dead mutants of EhAGCK1 showed significant defect in destruction of live host cells and also the localisation pattern of same is distinguishable from EhAGCK2. From observations so far, it appears that former initiates a distinguishable signaling cascade. In this work, we have demonstrated distinct biochemical properties of kinases involved in related yet distinguishable endocytic processes for the first time. Our biochemical characterization highlights distinct ion dependency of EhAGCK1 along with substrate specificity. We also show upstream activator of these kinases, 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) activity and its role in activating the kinase activity. The kinases exhibit property of autophosphorylation, and which may regulate the kinase activity subsequently. Summarily, these studies show that EhAGCK1 and EhAGCK2 show distinct biochemical properties which further confirm their unique role in related endocytic processes of trogocytosis and phagocytosis.

AB  - Background & objectives: Biobanks are crucial for biomedical research, enabling new treatments and medical advancements. The biobank at the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) aims to gather, process, store, and distribute biospecimens to assist scientific studies. Methods: This article details the profile of two cohorts: the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study and the Registry of people with diabetes in India with young age at onset (ICMR-YDR). The ICMR-INDIAB study is the largest epidemiological study on diabetes in India, encompassing a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 20 yr and older from urban and rural areas in every State across the country. The ICMR-YDR is the first national-level, multicentric clinic-based registry focusing on youth-onset diabetes in India, aiming to understand the disease patterns and variations in youth-onset diabetes across different country regions. Results: Key operations at the MDRF biobank include collecting and processing samples, where serum and whole blood samples are aliquoted and transferred through a cold chain to the central laboratory, and then stored in Siruseri (29 km from the capital city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu). Samples are barcoded, linked to subject information, and stored in freezers or liquid nitrogen (LN2) vessels, with inventory tracked via software for easy retrieval. A register records access to the biobank, ensuring sample integrity and compliance with regulatory requirements. The biobank adheres to the ICMR's National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research involving human participants. Interpretation & conclusions: The biobank enables the analysis of biomarkers in stored samples, aiding in scientifically sound decisions, treating patients, and potentially curing diabetes.

AB  - Background:Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a common gastrointestinal malignancy noted for its aggressive characteristics and poor prognosis, which is mostly caused by delayed detection. However, the scarcity of information regarding somatic mutations in Indian patients with GBC has hampered the development of efficient therapeutic options. In the present study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing the mutational profile of GBC.Materials and methods:To evaluate the somatic mutation profile, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 66 tumor and matched blood samples from individuals with GBC. Somatic variant calling was performed using GATK pipeline. Variants were annotated at pathogenic and oncogenic levels, using ANNOVAR, VEP tools and the OncoKB database. Mutational signature analysis, oncogenic pathway analysis and cancer driver genes identification were performed at the functional level by using the maftools package.Results:Our findings focused on the eight most altered genes with pathogenic and oncogenic mutations: TP53, SMAD4, ERBB3, KRAS, ARID1A, PIK3CA, RB1, and AXIN1. Genes with pathogenic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were enriched in oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly RTK-RAS, WNT, and TP53 pathways. Furthermore, our research related certain mutational signatures, such as cosmic 1, cosmic 6, and cosmic 18, 29, to known characteristics including patient age and tobacco smoking, providing important insights into disease etiology.Conclusions:Given the scarcity of exome-based sequencing studies focusing on the Indian population, this study represents a significant step forward in providing a framework for additional in-depth mutational analysis. Genes with substantial oncogenic and pathogenic mutations are promising candidates for developing targeted mutation panels, particularly for GBC detection.

AB  - The Descemet membrane (DM) is the basement membrane of corneal endothelial cells, which are responsible for maintaining corneal transparency. DM detachment (DMD) can occur due to various reasons, with the most common etiology being post-surgical. Older age, blunt instruments, and faulty surgical technique predispose to the intraoperative or postoperative occurrence of DMD, and one should have a high index of suspicion for DMD in cases with unexplained or an atypical pattern of corneal edema after surgery. Prompt intervention for DMD management is imperative to effect early visual rehabilitation, decrease corneal morbidity, and avoid permanent damage leading to scarring of the cornea. Various classifications of DMD and management protocols have been described. Anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging is the most effective imaging to detect DMD and quantify its extent. Desmetopexy with air/gas is the initial treatment of choice and could be aided by suture fixation. Non-responsive cases might need endothelial keratoplasty.

AB  - Exercise has numerous health benefits in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRDs). Regular physical activity can help maintain/improve bone health. The aim of the present article was to review current knowledge on the effects of exercise on bone health in patients with AIRDs, particularly in those experiencing a high corticosteroid burden. The article also aimed to discuss potential mechanisms underlying the benefits of physical activity/exercise on bone tissue. Potential explanations regarding the role of exercise on bone health in AIRDs include anti-inflammatory effects, mechanical loading, improvement in muscle strength, hormonal changes, improvement in balance, and effects on telomere erosion, deoxyribonucleic acid methylation, and gene expression. Current evidence regarding the outcomes of exercise on bone health in patients with AIRDs is predominantly derived from studies focused on rheumatoid arthritis. Expanding research to include other rheumatic conditions would enhance the overall understanding of this topic.

AB  - Background Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness. Patients with trachomatous corneal opacity (TCO) are traditionally considered high-risk cases for graft failure. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that corneal transplantation may restore vision in such individuals. We wanted to review the available evidence for keratoplasty outcomes in TCO. Methods A literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science was performed using the search terms "trachoma* AND (keratoplasty OR cornea* transplant*)". The search was restricted to studies published between 1 January 1992 and 12 October 2022. All types of prospective and retrospective study designs reporting outcomes of keratoplasty in trachoma were included. The primary outcome assessed was rate of graft survival in patients with TCO who received keratoplasty. Secondary outcomes were postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and graft rejection rates. Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. None were prospective trials; 215/302 grafts (71%) were clear at final follow-up. There was significant variability between studies in the reporting of patient characteristics, follow-up, complications, and outcomes. In data on penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), graft survival at final follow-up was observed in 161/195 eyes (83%). Studies assessing lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) reported graft survival in 18/20 eyes (90%). Rejection episodes were reported in 31/167 (19%) eyes managed with PKP and 0 of 20 eyes managed with LKP. Of 163 eyes, preoperative BCVA was <= counting fingers in 76% and <= 6/60 in 91%. A postoperative BCVA of >6/60 was achieved in 63% of eyes. Conclusions There is a paucity of evidence supporting keratoplasty in TCO. However, it may hold visual rehabilitation promise for people whose needs have to date been largely ignored. More structured reporting of outcomes from centres which perform keratoplasty in TCO and a well-designed prospective study would be valuable additions to the literature.

AB  - Objective: To estimate objective cut-off values for Bath ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) corresponding to Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with CRP (ASDAS) cut-off values (1.3, 2.1, and 3.5), and for interval changes (Delta BASDAI) corresponding to Delta ASDAS (1.1 and 2). Methods: In this multicentric study, adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) treated with either tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously fortnightly were recruited. Available paired data on BASDAI and ASDAS and paired interval change of these parameters (taken at least 3-months apart) were analyzed. Cut-off values for BASDAI were determined from a multinomial logistic regression and that for Delta BASDAI were determined with ordinal logistic regression with predicted probabilities. Diagnostics were assessed with correct classification rate (CRR), polychoric correlations (PCC), Goodman and Kruskal Gamma (GKG), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: Total 962 observations of paired data and 670 interval change data were available from 266 patient (mean age 35 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean BASDAI 2.7, and mean ASDAS 2.1). Following ASDAS classes were observed: inactive disease 131 (13.6%), moderate disease activity 322 (33.5%), high disease activity 420 (43.65%), and very high disease activity 89 (9.25%). The three cut-offs generated for BASDAI were 0.8, 2.5, and 6 for BASDAI and those for Delta BASDAI were 2 and 4. The CRR for BASDAI cut-offs was 65.59 and that for Delta BASDAI was 54.9. For the BASDAI cut-offs, both PCC and GKG showed high values (> 0.85) and the MCC was 0.471. Conclusion: In patients with axSpA, without any clinical or serological confounders, BASDAI values 0.8, 2.5, and 6 corresponded to ASDAS-CRP values 1.3, 2.1, and 3.5, respectively, and Delta BASDAI values of 2 and 4 correspond to Delta ASDAS cut-offs of 1.1 and 2.

AB  - Background:There is lack of data on bipolar disorder (BD) type II from India.Aim:To compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BD-I and BD-II using the data of the Bipolar Disorder Course and Outcome study from India (BiD-CoIN study).Methodology:Using the data of the BiD-CoIN study, patients with BD-I and BD-II were compared for demographic and clinical variables.Results:Out of the 773 patients, 59 (7.63%) participants had BD-II. Compared to BD-I, patients with BD-II had a higher income; were more often unemployed or housewives; had a higher mean number of episodes per year of illness, higher severity of depressive episodes, higher depressive affective morbidity, and a higher number of hypomanic episodes (in the lifetime, and number of episodes per year of illness); received lower doses of lithium and a lower number of medications; and had lower prevalence of alcohol dependence, higher prevalence of seasonality, a high proportion of them sought faith healing treatment, and a higher proportion of them have predominant depressive polarity.Conclusions:Patients with BD-I and BD-II differ from each other on certain demographic and clinical variables. The difference in the clinical variables suggests that the patients with BD-II may require different treatment approaches for management.

AB  - ObjectiveGlycogen storage disorders (GSD), inherent disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, feature hypoglycemia as a hallmark. Normoglycemia and glucose monitoring are pivotal in disease management. Conventional glucometer-based monitoring may overlook hypoglycemic trends. This study assesses glycemic control in Asian Indian GSD children using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and its role in facilitating dietary adjustments.MethodsA pre-post study enrolled molecularly confirmed GSDI, GSDIII, GSDVI, and GSDIX patients for baseline dietary compliance and CGM-based glycemic status evaluation. Hypoglycemic patients were stratified into diet-compliant and diet-noncompliant groups. Noncompliant patients received dietary reinforcement; compliant individuals underwent dietary adjustments. Repeat CGM (rCGM) was performed 6 weeks to 6 months postadjustments. Clinical and metabolic parameters were re-evaluated at 6 months.ResultsOf the 20 patients assessed at baseline, 11 were diet compliant. Six among these exhibited hypoglycemia, prompting diet adjustments. Among nine noncompliant patients, eight experienced hypoglycemia and received diet reinforcement. rCGM in 10 patients (five GSDI, three GSDIII, and two GSDIXc) showed a significant reduction in hypoglycemia duration in all. An improvement in height and body mass index was observed in all GSDI and GSDIII patients. Triglyceride levels, raised at baseline in two GSDI and one GSDIII, showed a substantial decline in one GSDI patient. Hepatic transaminase levels decreased in both GSDIXc patients. Plasma lactate levels decreased in all GSDI patients.ConclusionCGM is an efficacious adjunct in the personalized management of hepatic GSD patients, in the Asian Indian population. The study also underscores the need for long-term follow-up to determine the role of glycemic management in growth, general well-being, and metabolic control in the GSD subtypes.

AB  - Background: Gout is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by elevated uric acid levels in the blood, which can precipitate acute gout attacks in individuals with genetic susceptibility, existing medical conditions, and dietary influences. Genetic predispositions, comorbid medical conditions, nutritional choices, and environmental factors increasingly recognize the multifactorial etiology of the disease. Methods: Recent research has highlighted the potential of phytochemicals, particularly flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids, to manage hyperuricemia (HUA) and its associated complications. Results: Plant's natural compounds have garnered attention for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and uric acid-lowering properties, suggesting their role in alternative and complementary medicine. Phytochemicals have demonstrated promise in mitigating gout symptoms and potentially modifying the disease course by addressing different aspects of hyperuricemia and inflammation. Herbal remedies, with their complex phytochemical profiles, offer a unique advantage by potentially complementing conventional pharmacological treatments. The integration of herbal therapies with standard medications could lead to enhanced therapeutic outcomes through synergistic effects, optimizing disease management, and improving patient quality of life. Conclusions: This review examines the current understanding of the multifaceted etiology of gout, explores the role of phytochemicals in managing hyperuricemia, and discusses the potential benefits of combining herbal remedies with conventional treatments to improve patient care and therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Oncocytic renal neoplasms are a major source of diagnostic challenge in genitourinary pathology; however, they are typically nonaggressive in general, raising the question of whether distinguishing different subtypes, including emerging entities, is necessary. Emerging entities recently described include eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC), low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT), and papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP). A survey was shared among 65 urologic pathologists using SurveyMonkey.com (Survey Monkey, Santa Clara, CA, USA). De-identified and anonymized respondent data were analyzed. Sixty-three participants completed the survey and contributed to the study. Participants were from Asia (n=21; 35%), North America (n=31; 52%), Europe (n=6; 10%), and Australia (n=2; 3%). Half encounter oncocytic renal neoplasms that are difficult to classify monthly or more frequently. Most (70%) indicated that there is enough evidence to consider ESC RCC as a distinct entity now, whereas there was less certainty for LOT (27%), EVT (29%), and PRNRP (37%). However, when combining the responses for sufficient evidence currently and likely in the future, LOT and EVT yielded>70% and>60% for PRNRP. Most (60%) would not render an outright diagnosis of oncocytoma on needle core biopsy. There was a dichotomy in the routine use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the evaluation of oncocytoma (yes=52%; no=48%). The most utilized IHC markers included keratin 7 and 20, KIT, AMACR, PAX8, CA9, melan A, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)B, and fumarate hydratase (FH). Genetic techniques used included TSC1/TSC2/MTOR (67%) or TFE3 (74%) genes and pathways; however, the majority reported using these very rarely. Only 40% have encountered low-grade oncocytic renal neoplasms that are deficient for FH. Increasing experience with the spectrum of oncocytic renal neoplasms will likely yield further insights into the most appropriate work-up, classification, and clinical management for these entities.

KW  - Monoclonal gammopathy
KW  - nemaline rods
KW  - sporadic late-onset myopathy
AB  - Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy is a rare, acquired, sub-acute, adult-onset myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness and nemaline rods in the myofibers. In contrast to its congenital form, the prevalence in adult population is comparatively rare. Herein, we report a case of 60-year-old male who presented with insidious onset proximal muscle weakness with myopathic pattern on electromyography. Histopathological examination showed type 1 and 2 muscle fiber atrophy with minimal chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Modified Gomori trichrome staining revealed granular deposits in the myofibers. Ultrastructure examination showed numerous nemaline rods in the myofibers; hence, the diagnosis of sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy was rendered. Its association with monoclonal protein has been reported in the past. One should be aware of this rare entity as without correct diagnosis, there can be treatment failure and unfavorable outcome.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the safety, efficacy, and visual outcomes of topography-guided (TG) LASIK ablation versus advanced ablation algorithm (AAA) on Zeiss Mel 90 on virgin eyes.Setting:A tertiary care hospital in north India.Design:A retrospective comparative study.Methods:Case sheets of 30 patients who underwent TG LASIK and 45 patients who underwent AAA LASIK between January 2021 and September 2022 were retrieved and reviewed. The TG group included 60 eyes of 30 patients, and the AAA group included age- and sex-matched 90 eyes of 45 patients. Both groups were compared for visual outcomes, residual refraction, and root-mean-square higher-order aberrations (rms HOA) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively and using unpaired t-test and Mann-Whitney U test.Results:The mean preoperative spherical equivalent in the TG group and AAA group was - 3.12 (1.67) and - 3.19 (1.61), respectively. The safety and efficacy of the treatment were 100% in both groups. The postoperative increase in rms HOA was comparable in both groups (P = 0.55). The ablation duration was significantly longer in topo-guided LASIK (P = 0.001).Conclusion:AAA LASIK on MEL 90 is comparable to topography-guided LASIK for the management of low myopia and myopic astigmatism.

AB  - Low vision and blindness are increasing public health issues impacting individuals' quality of life. During clinical low-vision services, vision rehabilitation is crucial for enhancing daily living skills and improving life quality. Low-vision and rehabilitation (LVR) services encompass comprehensive measures that aid visually disabled individuals in restoring function, autonomy, and social participation. Such holistic management requires a multidisciplinary approach, facilitating adaptation to environmental and sociocultural changes. However, the lack of awareness about the principles and practices of LVR services poses a major hindrance to setting up such a special clinic in the eye hospital. This article is about a consensus statement on the guidelines for establishing LVR services focusing on basic requirements, especially in low-resource countries. The present recommendation to set up an LVR clinic was made after group discussions and debates among various experts and stakeholders during the National Workshop on Strengthening Low-Vision and Rehabilitation Services organized at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The event was participated by many ophthalmologists and optometrists coming from across the country. The recommendations required at the tertiary level are outlined under the four headings: Human resources and training: two ophthalmologists, that is, a low vision specialist or a well-experienced in low vision and one who has received one-week orientation and training, one optometrist, one rehabilitation supervisor, and two rehabilitation assistants; Assessment equipment: basic screening and diagnostic; Assistive devices for low vision, including, digital and non-digital; Assistive devices for rehabilitation, and methods for records maintenance. The institution may not follow strictly the present guidelines but will provide an idea on LVR services initiation.

AB  - Drug courts are specialized programs from the courts that aim to offer a chance to individuals with substance-related problems encountering law enforcement to take treatment rather than face incarceration. The aim of this debate is to critically debate the utility, applicability, and feasibility of drug courts in India. This is a theoretical debate based on the existing evidence and considerations of ground realities in the country. There is enough evidence that drug courts are effective in decreasing substance use and decreasing rearrests. These courts have been demonstrated to be cost-effective, and they seemingly decrease the burden on traditional courts. However, it can also potentially lead to discrimination of marginalized groups while at the same time can be seen to be punitive and coercive. Legal provisions exist that may facilitate the development of such programs. Nonetheless, there is a scrupulous consideration of the pros and cons of drug courts and their operational considerations in the local context.

AB  - We describe the hybrid technique of tuck-in Tenon's patch graft (TPG) and tissue adhesive bandaged contact lens (TABCL) for large corneal perforations (>5 mm) with intact surrounding stroma. Management of large corneal perforation is often challenging, and urgent availability of donor cornea might be difficult; Tenon patch alone does not provide tectonic support; hence, this hybrid technique can be used safely in large perforations. This involves freshening the perforation edges, creating a 3600 stromal pocket, harvesting a Tenon's graft 1 mm oversized, tucking into the pocket, and suturing. Then areas of leakage were noted, and only those areas were supplemented with minimal cyanoacrylate glue (CG) at the graft edges. This technique was used in two eyes, one with a large corneal perforation and intact surrounding stroma and the other with 4 mm corneal fistula post healed keratitis with a failed primary TPG alone, and led to epithelialization and a smooth corneal surface at 6 weeks. The advantages include autologous tissue, cost-effective, easily available, minimal post-operative inflammation, vascularization, and surface irregularity.

AB  - Background & objectives: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most prevalent healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). They cause significant morbidity, leading to excess health expenditures and increased length of hospital stay. Despite a high population burden, data on post-discharge SSIs is lacking from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is no existing surveillance system of SSIs in India that covers the post-discharge period. Therefore, we proposed a multicentric analysis to estimate the proportion and identify the risk factors associated with SSIs occurring during hospital stay and after discharge. Methods: SSI Surveillance was conducted in three hospitals in different parts of India according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (30 days-6 months). An indigenous database was developed for data entry and analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test for an association between SSI and potential risk factors. Results: A total of 161 out of 3090 patients acquired SSI, resulting in a 5.2 per cent SSI incidence. Debridement surgery, which was carried out with either an amputation, open reduction internal fixation surgery (ORIF), or closed reduction internal fixation (CRIF) surgery, had the highest SSI rate (54.2%). Clean, polluted wound class and surgeries lasting longer than 120 minutes were substantially linked to an increased risk of SSI. Interpretation & conclusions: Post-discharge surveillance helped with the detection of 66 per cent of SSI cases. Combination surgeries were seen to increase the risk of SSIs in patients.

AB  - Melittin is a major active ingredient of the bee venom produced by honeybees (Apis mellifera) that exerts various biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, and antioxidant. The role of melittin in modulating melanin production by melanocytes is not known. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the effect of melittin on melanin production by human melanocytes along with its antioxidant status. Cultured human melanocytes were treated with melittin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, followed by the study of the cell viability, cell proliferation, and total melanin content. The effects of melittin in combination with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) on the total melanin content, melanocyte dendricity, oxidative stress, and the expression of genes associated with melanogenesis were investigated. An increased melanin content was observed with a low dose of melittin (LDM) (alone or in combination with NB-UVB), and there was a corresponding increase in the tyrosinase activity, melanocyte dendricity, and melanogenesis-associated genes. The present study concluded that LDM alone or LDM (+NB-UVB) can induce melanin synthesis by increasing the tyrosinase activity in melanocytes by limiting the oxidative stress, and this may be therapeutically exploited as an adjuvant therapy for vitiligo.

AB  - We report two cases of established Wilson's disease (WD) presenting with calcific myonecrosis of the pelvic girdle in association with pelvic fractures. Despite initial improvement with chelation, subacute worsening of ambulation in both led to a consideration of neurologic deterioration on chelation therapy. However, evaluation revealed calcific myonecrosis of the hip joint and adjacent muscles as the cause. Both patients improved with intensive rehabilitation. A review of literature indicates that although osseomuscular complications are reported in WD, calcific myonecrosis is a hitherto unknown entity which, if recognized early, may be reversed, preventing disability and unnecessary change in chelation regimens.

AB  - Background: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis (SDSE) is an emerging pathogen causing pharyngitis and post-streptococcal sequelae like S. pyogenes. SDSE was initially considered a commensal microorganism inhabiting the upper respiratory tract and skin. However, recently it has gained attention due to an increase in the invasive SDSE infections, which were reported in the early 20th century. Objectives: The aim of this review is to bring awareness of SDSE in the medical microbiologists because often its ignorance leads to the under reporting or misdiagnosis of SDSE. This also highlights the clinical spectrum of infections and the molecular epidemiology of SDSE. Content: Diagnosis of SDSE in clinical laboratories is challenging, because SDSE can be seen expressing either of the three Lancefield antigen Groups, Group A, C, and G. While MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Time-of-Flight) is a discriminatory method for identifying SDSE, its high cost can limit its use in many laboratories. Currently, there is limited data on SDSE, and further studies are required to associate the disease outcome and the emm type/ST of SDSE in India and other developing countries. This review highlights the importance of recognizing SDSE as an emerging pathogen, and to screen for SDSE in infections similar to S. pyogenes, especially in regions such as India with a high incidence of Streptococcal diseases.

AB  - Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is being increasingly utilized to visualize the brain areas involved in cognitive activity to understand the human brain better. Its portability and easy setup give it an advantage over other functional brain imaging tools. The current study utilizes fNIRS while performing a Stroop test, which is commonly used to assess the impairment of information selection in depression. Aim: To compare cortical activation during the Stroop test in depressed individuals to healthy controls. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) concentration changes in 39 individuals with depression to 40 healthy individuals. The Stroop test was construed in an event-related design with an intertrial interval of 2 seconds with jitter. A continuous wave fNIRS system was used for recording the cortical activity at 17 locations. Analysis of fNIRS data was done using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for estimating general linear model (GLM) coefficients. Further analysis of the mean change of OxyHb concentrations during the 2 seconds after the presentation of congruent and incongruent stimuli was done between the groups using Mann-Whitney U test corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Results: While the number of errors and correct responses were similar between the groups, the reaction time for correct responses was more in the depression group in comparison to healthy individuals (t = -2.39, P = 0.01). For both healthy and depressive individuals in incongruent versus congruent task contrast, deactivation was seen in the region between the left middle frontal sulcus and frontopolar area of the brain (t = 0.41 and t = 0.21, respectively, P < 0.05). The depressed group had a higher mean change in OxyHb concentration following incongruent stimuli in comparison to the HCs (mean rank: HC = 32.63, depression = 47.56). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that individuals with depression exhibited prolonged reaction times and distinct activation patterns of the frontal cortex compared to healthy individuals. The observed pattern of brain activation for congruent and incongruent tasks among both healthy and depressed individuals aligns with the findings of the prior studies, emphasizing the utility of fNIRS as a valuable instrument for assessing brain activity.

AB  - Aromatase inhibitors play a critical therapeutic role in treating ER+ breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. However, their efficacy is often limited by resistance and severe side effects. Identifying new compounds that can disrupt aromatase enzyme function is essential. In this study, structural anomalies in the aromatase enzyme were corrected through energy minimization, and the structure was validated via Ramachandran plot. We screened 170,269 natural compounds from the ASINEX Biodesign library using high-throughput screening algorithms to target the aromatase enzyme. Molecular docking identified three compounds: BDD30170158, BDE33872639, and BDE30177677, all showing stable binding interactions with the aromatase enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns confirmed the conformational stability of these compounds. Although all three compounds exhibited the desired pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism properties, only one compound (BDE33872639) was identified as a non-blocker, demonstrating a reduced risk of adverse cardiac effects. This compound exhibits significant potential as a novel aromatase inhibitor, warranting further experimental research to develop it as a therapeutic option for ER+ breast cancer.

AB  - Inhibiting the immune checkpoint (ICP) PD-1 based on PD-L1 expression status has revolutionized the treatment of various cancers, yet its efficacy in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains limited. The therapeutic response depends upon multiple factors, particularly the conduciveness of the tumor's immune milieu. This study comprehensively evaluated and classified ATC's immune microenvironment (IME) to elucidate the factors behind suboptimal response to anti-PD therapy. Utilizing multiplex-immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, we retrospectively analyzed 26 cases of ATC for expression of ICPs PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA4, TIM3, and Galectin-9 and tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)-the effector cells, the anti-tumor NK cells, the immune-inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressor (MDSC) and regulatory T (Treg) cells, and B lymphocytes. Most ATCs (65%) exhibited PD-L1 positivity, but only 31%, in addition, had abundant CTL (type I IME), a combination associated with a better response to ICP inhibition. Additionally, PD-1 expression levels on CTL were low/absent in most cases-a "target-missing" situation-unfavorable for an adequate therapeutic response. All but one ATC showed nuclear Galectin-9 expression. The documentation of nuclear expression of Galectin-9 akin to benign thyroid is a first, and its role in ATC pathobiology needs further elucidation. In addition to less abundant PD-1 expression on CTL, the presence of MDSC, Treg, and exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the immune milieu of ATC can contribute to anti-PD resistance. TIM3, the most frequently expressed ICP on CTL, followed by CTLA4, provides alternate therapeutic targets in ATC. The co-expression of multiple immune checkpoints is of great interest for ATC since these data also open the avenue for combination therapies.

AB  - The rising burden of dementia calls for high-quality data on cognitive decline and dementia onset. The second wave of the Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) was designed to provide longitudinal assessments of cognition and dementia in India. All Wave 1 participants were recruited for a follow-up interview, and a refresher sample was drawn from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, a nationally representative cohort of Indians aged 45 and older. Respondents underwent a battery of cognitive tests, geriatric assessments, and venous blood collection. Their health and cognitive status were also assessed through an interview with a close family member or friend. Clinical consensus diagnosis was made based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (R), and comprehensive data on risk factors of dementia were collected, including neurodegenerative biomarkers, sensory function, and environmental exposures. A total of 4635 participants were recruited between 2022 and 2024 from 22 states and union territories of India, accounting for 97.9% of the population in India. The response rate was 84.0%, and 71.5% of the participants provided venous blood specimen. LASI-DAD provides rich new data to study cognition, dementia, and their risk factors longitudinally in a nationally representative sample of older adults in India. Longitudinal cognitive data, together with longitudinally assessed biomarker data and novel data on sensory function and environmental exposures, provide a unique opportunity to establish associations between risk factors and biologically defined cognitive aging phenotypes.

AB  - Purpose: To report the occurrence of unilateral, neonatal-onset congenital glaucoma in a child with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RTS). Case report: A 15-day-old male with features of RTS was presented with an enlarged corneal diameter, corneal haze, and peripheral corneal vascularization of the left eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of his left eye revealed iris atrophy, iridocorneal adhesions, and iris adhesions to a partially absorbed cataractous lens. Genetic evaluation of the child and the parents revealed a novel de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant in exon 5 of the CREBBP gene (NM_004380.3:c.1390C>T). A diode laser cyclophotocoagulation was performed to control the IOP in the left eye. Conclusion: Unilateral neonatal-onset congenital glaucoma due to iridocorneal adhesions can be a rare presentation of Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome.

AB  - Background: The Delphi consensus study was carried out under the auspices of the International and Asia-Pacific Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Associations (IHPBA-APHPBA) to develop practice guidelines for management of gallbladder cancer (GBC) globally. Method: GBC experts from 17 countries, spanning 6 continents, participated in a hybrid four-round Delphi consensus development process. The methodology involved email, online consultations, and in-person discussions. Sixty eight clinical questions (CQs) covering various domains related to GBC, were administered to the experts. A consensus recommendation was accepted only when endorsed by more than 75% of the participating experts. Results: Out of the sixty experts invited initially to participate in the consensus process 45 (75%) responded to the invitation. The consensus was achieved in 92.6% (63/68) of the CQs. Consensus covers epidemiological aspects of GBC, early, incidental and advanced GBC management, definitions for radical GBC resections, the extent of liver resection, lymph node dissection, and definitions of borderline resectable and locally advanced GBC. Conclusions: This is the first international Delphi consensus on GBC. These recommendations provide uniform terminology and practical clinical guidelines on the current management of GBC. Unresolved contentious issues like borderline resectable/locally advanced GBC need to be addressed by future clinical studies.

AB  - Background Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated immune responses, with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) playing a significant role. NETs are recognized by autoantibodies in SLE patients, exacerbating pathology. Both excessive NET formation and impaired degradation contribute to SLE pathophysiology.Objective To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of Dexamethasone-primed Wharton's jelly (WJ) derived MSCs CM (DW) and IFN-gamma-primed WJ-MSCs-CM (IW) on NETosis and associated protein markers in SLE patients' LPS or ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (RNP ICs) induced neutrophils and in pristane induced lupus (PIL) model. And to elucidate the mechanism involved therein.Methods We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of DW and IW on NETosis in SLE. Utilizing ex vivo and in vivo models, we assessed the impact of preconditioned media on NET formation and associated protein markers neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone (citH3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS production. We also examined the involvement of key immunomodulatory factors present in DW and IW, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).Results Preconditioned media effectively suppressed NETosis and reduced ROS generation in SLE neutrophils, indicating their immunomodulatory potential. Inhibition studies implicated IDO and PGE2 in mediating this effect. Combined treatment with DW or IW together with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) demonstrated superior efficacy over HCQ alone, a standard SLE medication. In PIL mouse model, DW and IW treatments reduced NETosis, ROS generation, as evidenced by decreased NET-associated protein expression in vital organs.Conclusion Our study highlights the multifaceted impact of IW and DW on NETosis, ROS dynamics, and lupus severity in SLE. These findings underscore the potential of preconditioned media for the development of targeted, personalized approaches for SLE treatment.

AB  - IntroductionTo evaluate the efficacy and side effects of re-circulant hyperthermic intravesical chemotherapy versus conventional treatments for intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).MethodsA randomized 3-arm, parallel group trial was conducted at a single tertiary care centre. 135 patients with low-grade intermediate-risk cancer, having undergone complete resection of bladder tumor were included. Patients were assigned 1:1:1, to receive intra-vesical chemo-hyperthermia (C-HT), mitomycin-C (MMC) or BCG therapy. There was no treatment crossover. Patients were followed up with check cystoscopy every 3 months for histopathological recurrence.ResultsThe three arms were comparable in terms of age, gender, tumor size, number of tumors and clinical stage or grade of tumors. Mean tumor size was 2.58 (+/- 0.88) cm and the mean number of tumors resected was 2.04 (+/- 1.02) (Range 1-5). There was no significant difference between the various groups for tumor recurrence (chi 2 = 1.96, p = 0.375) or time to recurrence (13.6 vs. 10.8 vs. 9.8 months, p = 0.844) though incidence of non-healing necrotic area was higher with C-HT (22.2% vs. 11.1% and 4.8%, chi 2 = 6.093, p = 0.048). Median (IQR) follow up period was 26 (12-52) months. Treatment discontinuation or drug intolerance was significantly higher in BCG arm (p = 0.03).ConclusionsIntravesical C-HT with MMC, conventional MMC and BCG are equally effective and comparable alternatives for intravesical therapy in low-grade intermediate-risk NMIBC. Higher incidence of non-healing resection site with C-HT and higher local symptoms with BCG are a concern.

AB  - The histomorphological features predictive of p16 and human papilloma virus (HPV DNA) positivity in oropharyngeal carcinoma have been a matter of much debate. However, only few studies have been done on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to correlate the histomorphological features with p16 and HPV DNA positivity. Oral squamous cell carcinoma has distinct etiopathogenesis, treatment and prognosis as compared to oropharyngeal carcinomas. A total of 800 oral squamous cell carcinoma biopsy cases were evaluated for features suggestive of HPV infection like basaloid appearance, absence of stromal reaction, nests and lobules of tumor cells with pushing borders, central necrosis, lympho-epithelial morphology, koilocytes, and non-keratinizing or hybrid morphology. Immunohistochemistry was performed for p16 expression (E6H4 clone, CINtec histology, Roche diagnostics). The cases which showed 2+/3+ (from moderate to high intensity) staining with >75 % cells were considered as p16 immunopositive. All the p16 immunopositive cases were subjected to real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for HPV DNA detection to confirm HPV positivity. A total of 139 (17.37 %) OSCC cases were p16 immunopositive and out of these 104 (104/139, 74.8 %) cases showed HPV-DNA PCR positivity. None of the features were found to be predictive on multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, on bivariable analysis, nest/lobule with pushing border was the only histopathological feature which had a significant correlation with p16 immunopositivity (P value = 0.0001) and p16 and HPV DNA copositivity (P value = 0.0001). (Fisher's exact test -two tailed). To conclude-morphology is not really predictive of HPV positivity in OSCC cases. Only one feature- nests and lobule with pushing border is suggestive on bivariable analysis.

AB  - Objectives: Previous studies generally used cross-sectional data and focused on under-five children to assess the risk factors for malnutrition among Indian children. Some recent studies have reported that recovery from or faltering in malnutrition is possible after five years of age, but socio-demographic subgroup disparities have not been explored. This study aims to find the longitudinal disparity in height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) and body-mass-index-for-age Z-scores (BMIAZ scores) across various sub-groups of a cohort from childhood to adolescence. Methods: This study used a cohort from the Young Lives Survey, which followed children aged of 1-15 years between 2002 and 2016-17 in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, India. Mixed-effect models were applied to find the main, time, and interaction effects of HAZ scores and BMIAZ scores. In addition, an extended Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach to assess group-based differences over time was used. Results: The cross-sectional prevalence of stunting reduced across all subgroups, while thinness rose during the same period. The interactions of child sex, mother's education, place of residence, wealth index, and antenatal care with time were statistically significant at p <0.05. The gender disparity in adjusted HAZ score decreased from 0.214 units at 1 year to 0.011 units at 15 years, whereas BMIAZ score differential increased from 0.106 to 0.538 units over same timeframe. Disparities in scores were also observed across rural-urban, maternal education, social group, religion, socioeconomic status, maternal age at birth, antenatal care, and premature birth status. Conclusion: The study sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of paediatric growth, emphasising the importance of longitudinal approaches in understanding and addressing the health disparities across different stages of childhood and adolescence.

AB  - BackgroundMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for immune modulation in various diseases that are associated with dysregulated immune responses like Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD). MSCs are pleiotropic and the fate of MSCs following administration is a major determinant of their therapeutic efficacy.MethodsHuman MSCs were derived from bone marrow (BM) and Wharton's Jelly (WJ) and preconditioned through exposure to hypoxia and induction of apoptosis, either sequentially or simultaneously. The immune programming potential of preconditioned MSCs was evaluated by assessing their effects on T cell proliferation, induction of Tregs, programming of effector T-cell towards Th2 phenotype, macrophage polarization in the direct co-culture of MSCs and aGVHD patients-derived PBMNCs. Additionally, efferocytosis of MSCs and relative change in the expression of immunomodulatory soluble factors were examined.ResultsOur study demonstrated that hypoxia preconditioned apoptotic MSCs (BM-MSCs, WJ-MSCs) bear more immune programming ability in a cellular model of acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (aGVHD). Our findings revealed that WJ-MSCsHYP+APO were superior to BM-MSCsHYP+APO for immune regulation. These induced the differentiation of CD4+T-cell into Tregs, enhanced Th2 effector responses, and simultaneously mitigated Th1- and Th17 responses. Additionally, this approach led to the polarization of M1 macrophages toward an M2 phenotype.ConclusionOur study highlights the potential of WJ-MSCs conditioned with hypoxia and apoptosis concurrently, as a promising therapeutic strategy for aGVHD. It underscores the importance of considering MSC apoptosis in optimizing MSCs-based cellular therapy protocols for enhanced therapeutic efficacy in aGvHD.

AB  - Posterior fossa congenital pial arteriovenous fistulas are rare vascular anomalies associated with high morbidity. These anomalies often present challenges to neurointerventionists due to their complex morphological features. We successfully treated two technically challenging, infratentorial large pial arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) associated with complete flow steal in the basilar artery. The first case involved an 18-year-old male with a posterior fossa single-hole AVF characterized by dilated venous pouches and retrograde venous reflux. After an unsuccessful initial coiling attempt, this patient was treated using a double microcatheter coiling technique, supported by a large balloon for flow control. The second case involved a 9-month-old infant with a complex two-hole posterior fossa pial AVF and a large venous sac. This patient was treated with coil embolization of the fistula and with balloon protection of the vertebrobasilar junction. Both patients recovered without postoperative complications and showed significant improvement on follow-up. These cases provide valuable insights into the management and characteristics of pial arteriovenous fistulas.

AB  - Background: A glaring gender inequality persists in global neurosurgery, influenced by various factors, including the notion that female neurosurgeons have lower academic output. This study aims to compare the research output of female and male neurosurgeons at the leading academic institutions in India. Methods: The pertinent details regarding female neurosurgeons were collected from the Neurological Society of India (NSI) and Women In Neurosurgery (India) database. The institutes with at least five neurosurgery faculty recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) were included in the study. Various bibliometric parameters of male and female faculty at these academic centres were collected and compared using PubMed and Web of Science databases. Results: Among the 2643 neurosurgeons in NSI, 113 were females (4.27%). Out of 156 faculty members across eighteen academic institutions, only seven (4.7%) were female, with eleven institutions lacking female faculty. Female academic neurosurgeons had slightly higher h-index (9.57 vs. 9.56), citation per publication (8.82 vs. 8.54), and original article percentage (47.5 vs. 46.5) compared to males. They also had more citations per year (34.01 vs. 33.17), while males had more total publications (51.19 vs. 46.71) and citations (565.22 vs. 533.57), but these differences weren't statistically significant. Only 4.1% (327/7955) of neurosurgery research was contributed by females. Female neurosurgeons authored articles received 3735 citations (4.2%) out of 87,953 total citations. Conclusion: Female academic neurosurgeons in India exhibit comparable or superior academic output compared to their male counterparts, suggesting gender equality or even superiority in certain aspects of academic performance.

AB  - CLINICAL QUESTION In adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), or psoriasis taking biologic drugs, does proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improve outcomes as compared with standard care? CONTEXT AND CURRENT PRACTICE Standard care for immune mediated inflammatory diseases includes prescribing biologic drugs at pre-determined doses. Dosing may be adjusted reactively, for example with increased disease activity. In proactive TDM, serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies are measured irrespective of disease activity, and the drug dosing is adjusted to achieve target serum drug levels, usually within pre-specified therapeutic ranges. The role of proactive TDM in clinical practice remains unclear, with conflicting guideline recommendations and emerging evidence from randomised controlled trials. THE EVIDENCE Linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. Inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, and psoriasis were grouped together as best current research evidence on proactive TDM did not suggest heterogeneity of effects on outcomes of interest. Proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment may increase the proportion of patients who experience sustained disease control or sustained remission without considerable additional harm. For adalimumab, it remains unclear if proactive TDM during maintenance treatment has an effect on sustained disease control or sustained remission. At induction (start) of treatment, proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab may have little or no effect on achieving remission. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of adalimumab at induction (start) of treatment. No eligible trial evidence was available for proactive TDM of other biologic drugs in maintenance or at induction (start) of treatment. RECOMMENDATIONS The guideline panel issued the following recommendations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, or psoriasis: 1. A weak recommendation in favour of proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment 2. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for adalimumab and other biologic drugs during maintenance treatment 3. A weak recommendation against proactive TDM for intravenous infliximab, adalimumab, and other biologic drugs during induction (start) of treatment. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS When considering proactive TDM, clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision making to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and preferences. The availability of laboratory assays to implement proactive TDM should also be considered. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED An international panel including patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis which identified 10 trials including 2383 participants. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC) significantly impacts patient well-being and often results in extensive healthcare resource utilization. This study assessed the VOC burden, its management and its impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between November 2021 and June 2022, including 1000 SCD patients from high-prevalence states in India. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, VOC severity, management and QoL were collected. The study revealed that 33.5% of patients reported at least one VOC episode during the study period. In the year prior to their enrolment, 836 (83.60%) patients reported at least one VOC episode, with an equal proportion of 407/487 (83.6%) adults and 429/513 (83.6%) paediatric patients, reducing their QoL across all domains compared to patients without VOC. Of these, 469/1000 patients (46.9%) experienced >= 3 VOC episodes. Additionally, 764/1000 (76.40%) patients managed their VOCs at healthcare facilities, with 501/1000 (50.1%) requiring inpatient admissions. Further, 71.80% of patients received Hydroxyurea (HU) therapy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant loss of central cholinergic neurons. This progressive deterioration leads to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, culminating in the brain cell's death at the later stages of the disease. The approved drugs for AD are limited to providing symptomatic relief for an initial period due to the multifaceted etiology of the disease. Several studies have demonstrated that rivastigmine (RIV) is a selectively potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase and devoid of antioxidant, A beta, and tau protein aggregation inhibition and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, to address these issues associated with RIV, novel rivastigmine-based molecules were rationally designed, synthesized, and evaluated in various in-vitro and in-vivo AD models. In in-vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition studies revealed that 3q & 6e as promising leads (AChE, IC50 1.72 f 0.15, 0.91 f 0.016 mu M, BChE, IC50 6.69 f 0.28 mu M, 1.19 f 0.026 mu M, for 3q & 6e , respectively). The computational studies (molecular docking and dynamics) further corroborated the in-vitro studies. Further, 3q and 6e were found to be potent antioxidants in the DPPH assay (IC50 16.15 f 1.05 & 15.17 f 0.07 mu M, for 3q & 6e , respectively). Interestingly, 3q, and 6e could effectively inhibit self-induced full-length tau and A beta 1-42 aggregation. Treatment with 3q & 6e inhibited microglial activation by attenuating ROS release and mitochondrial damage. Further, 3q & 6e also suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kappa B expression levels in microglial cells and halted the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human microglial cells. Finally, 3q & 6e were found to be efficacious in reversing the scopolamine-induced memory impairment in the Morris water maze test. The expression of various neuroprotection markers, such as BDNF and TRKB, was significantly overexpressed compared to the disease control group.

AB  - Germ cell tumors (GCTs) arise from primordial germ cells and can occur in any region along the path of migrating primordial germ cells. Retroperitoneal teratomas are such tumors usually arising in para-renal locations. These tumors have the propensity to grow to large sizes leading to distortion of the local anatomy and compressive symptoms. Surgical excision of these tumors is challenging, with high complication rates. Retrospective data of all the patients with retroperitoneal GCTs, managed from January 1998 through March 2020, was included. Patients with increased alpha-fetoprotein or with malignant histopathology were excluded. Maintained data sets of the included patients were evaluated for patient demographics, symptoms, radiologic and histologic findings, surgical procedures and postoperative outcomes. A total of 26 patients of retroperitoneal GCTs, comprising ten males and 16 females, were operated on at our centre. The median age at presentation was 10.5 months (1 day to 178 months). Most patients (n = 21/26) presented with a palpable abdominal mass. All the patients underwent operative intervention. Intraoperatively, 23% of patients had a tumor in close proximity to major vessels, while bowel involvement was present in 12%. Immature teratoma was present on histopathology in 15% of the patients. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months (1-168 months), and there were no recurrences reported in the cohort. Retroperitoneal GCTs have an excellent outcome if completely excised. The current study highlights the need for adequate preoperative evaluation and intraoperative visualization of the vital structures to achieve complete excision in these patients.

AB  - Introduction Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) estimation offers a non-invasive method to potentially diagnose, monitor, and prognosticate patients with malignancy. This prospective study aimed to assess plasma cfDNA levels in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) to determine its role in predicting disease status in the post-operative setting.Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted at a public medical research university and hospital in New Delhi, India. 254 patients with DTC in the post-operative setting were included: 95 in Group 1 (active structural disease) and 159 in Group 2 (disease-free). Blood samples were collected for plasma separation and cfDNA extraction. The cfDNA concentrations were quantified and compared across various disease states.Results Median values of plasma cfDNA (ng/mu L) in groups 1 and 2 were found to be 0.272 (IQR: 0.137-0.442) and 0.222 (IQR: 0.123-0.398), respectively with no significant difference (p=0.122). cfDNA levels were significantly higher in patients in the age group >= 55 years (p=0.016). However, the cfDNA levels were not significantly associated with any of the other known prognostic markers of DTC.Discussion Based on the results of this study, plasma cfDNA levels did not significantly predict disease status in patients with DTC in the post-operative setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations from heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. However, SGLT2i therapy's potential effects on the risks of dementia and Parkinson's disease are not well established, with conficting results based on observational studies. Hence, we sought to evaluate the association between SGLT2i and the risk of dementia and Parkinson's disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, and Clinicaltrial.gov for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception until March 2024 without any language restrictions. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials with 74,442 patients (40,784 in the SGLT2i group and 33,658 in the control group) were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients in SGLT2i and control was 65.3 and 65.2 years, respectively. Pooled analysis showed that there is no significant association between SGLT2i use and the risk of dementia (OR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.70-2.69; P = .36), dementia Alzheimer's type (OR 1.99; 95% CI, 0.59-6.71; P = . 27), vascular dementia (OR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-1.85; P = . 24), and Parkinson's disease (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.25-1.61; P = . 33) when compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that there is no significant association between SGLT2i use and the risk of dementia, its subtypes, and Parkinson's disease when compared with the control groups.

AB  - Ovarian reserve tests are valuable for evaluation of female fertility, and to formulate appropriate treatment strategies for infertile women. Antral follicle count (AFC) and Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) are most reliable markers of ovarian reserve which are related inversely to age. There are many factors that affect ovarian reserve like race, ethnicity, fertility status, BMI or any chronic illness. We conducted this study to find outage specific nomograms for AMH and AFC among fertile and Infertile Indian women, to find out any variations between fertile and Infertile ovarian reserves at various centiles, to define the age cut-off of decline in AMH and AFC among fertile and Infertile Indian women and to find correlation between AMH and AFC. It was a prospective cross sectional single centre study conducted at a tertiary hospital of northern India from March 2017 to February 2022. Fertile healthy women were recruited from family planning clinic, oocyte donors and subfertile women from Gynaecology and ART clinic. AMH was done using ELISA, Beckmann Coulter Gen II assay and AFC was done using TVS with high frequency probe (9.0 MHZ, Voluson,S-6, GE Healthcare, USA) by trained personnel. R Statistical Programming Language was used for statistical modelling and visualization. Age-specific AFC centile chart and AMH centile chart were generated using GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape) package available in R Statistical Computing Language. A Non-linear decline in ovarian reserves among fertile, while linear among infertile women was seen. Centiles defined for both groups with a faster decline in infertile women. Age cut off for decline in AMH and AFC in fertile women approximately 31 years using ROC analysis and Age cut off for decline in AMH and AFC in infertile women is approximately 34 years. There seems to be a good correlation between AFC and AMH. We need to counsel women to consider child bearing well before ovarian reserves decline (31-34 years).

AB  - Keratoconus is a progressive eye disorder primarily affecting individuals in adolescence and early adulthood. The ectatic changes in the cornea cause thinning and cone-like steepening leading to irregular astigmatism and reduced vision. Keratoconus is a complex disorder with a multifaceted aetiology and pathogenesis, including genetic, environmental, biomechanical and cellular factors. Environmental factors, such as eye rubbing, UV light exposure and contact lens wearing, are associated with disease progression. On the cellular level, a complex interplay of hormonal changes, alterations in enzymatic activity that modify extracellular membrane stiffness, and changes in biochemical and biomechanical signalling pathways disrupt collagen cross-linking within the stroma, contributing to structural integrity loss and distortion of normal corneal anatomy. Clinically, keratoconus is diagnosed through clinical examination and corneal imaging. Advanced imaging platforms have improved the detection of keratoconus, facilitating early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Treatment strategies for keratoconus are tailored to disease severity and progression. In early stages, vision correction with glasses or soft contact lenses may suffice. As the condition advances, rigid gas-permeable contact lenses or scleral lenses are prescribed. Corneal cross-linking has emerged as a pivotal treatment aimed at halting the progression of corneal ectasia. In patients with keratoconus with scarring or contact lens intolerance, surgical interventions are performed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a major public health concern. We aimed to assess the definitions, etiologic spectrum, organ failure (OF), and outcomes of ACLF globally. METHODS: Three databases were searched for studies on ACLF from 1990 until September 2022. Information regarding definitions, acute precipitants, underlying chronic liver disease (CLD), OF, and mortality were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed for pooled prevalence rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) using random-effects model for each definition of ACLF. RESULTS: Of the 11,451 studies identified, 114 articles (142 cohorts encompassing 210,239 patients) met the eligibility criteria. Most studies (53.2%) used the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) definition, followed by Asia-Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) (33.3%). Systemic infection was the major acute precipitant, and alcohol use was the major cause of CLD in EASL-defined studies, whereas alcohol was both the major acute precipitant and cause of CLD in APASL-defined studies. Liver failure was the major OF in APASL-based studies, whereas renal failure was predominant in EASL-based studies. Thirty-day mortality varied across definitions: APASL: 38.9%, 95% CI, 31.2%-46.9%; EASL: 47.9%, 95% CI, 42.2%-53.5%; and NACSELD: 52.2%, 95% CI, 51.9%-52.5%. Diagnostic overlap between definitions ranged from 7.7% to 80.2%. Meta-regression suggested that the World Health Organization region influenced 30-day mortality in studies using EASL definition. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity in the definition of ACLF proposed by different expert societies and regional preferences in its use result in differences in clinical phenotype and outcomes. A uniform definition would enhance the comparability and interpretation of global data.

AB  - Objective: The prevalence of post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is reported to be 20%-25%. There is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants for treating anxiety in such patients. This Prospective Randomized Open Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of fluoxetine in PSA. Methods: In this single-center pilot study conducted in India, post-stroke patients (between 1 to 6 months) were randomized to fluoxetine (intervention group: 20 mg/day for 12 weeks) or standard medical care (control group). The primary outcome was improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) at 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were anxiety remission (>50% improvement in HAM-A), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI), quality of life (SF-36), and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A linear regression analysis was done for determinants of HAM-A to account for baseline differences in the intervention and control groups. Results: A total of 60 patients were randomized: (30: intervention, 30: control). The overall prevalence of post-stroke anxiety among participants in the study was 50.8%, and 31.5% experienced both anxiety and depression. The average HAM-A score at baseline was 11, and average follow-up score at study conclusion was 4. There was similar improvement in the HAM-A score at 12 weeks post-randomization in the intervention and control groups [fluoxetine: -8.0 (95% CI = -11.0 to -4.0); control: -7.0 (95% CI = -9.5 to -4.0); P = 0.91]. Likewise, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups at 12 weeks post-randomization on the mRS, BI, SF-36, or HAM-D. There were no serious adverse events in either group during the study. Conclusion: Fluoxetine and standard medical care had comparable improvement in HAM-A in post-stroke patients with mild anxiety at 12 weeks. Further study of the pharmacological treatment of post-stroke patients with more severe anxiety is needed.

AB  - Importance The prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) varies across the globe. Indian studies on PCOS are limited by poor design, small sizes, regional representations, and varying methods. Objectives To estimate the nationwide prevalence of PCOS in India, examine the phenotypic spectrum, and assess the magnitude of comorbidities associated with PCOS. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study recruited 9824 women aged 18 to 40 years from November 1, 2018, to July 31, 2022, across 5 zones of the country. A prevalidated questionnaire dichotomized women into screen-positive and screen-negative groups. Relevant clinical, hormonal, and sonographic assessments categorized women as either women with criteria-based PCOS (ie, National Institutes of Health [NIH] 1990 criteria, Rotterdam 2003 criteria, or Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [AE-PCOS] criteria), women with partial phenotypes (hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, or polycystic morphology labeled as pre-PCOS), or healthy women, in addition to quantitating various comorbidities. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence and phenotypes of PCOS among women of reproductive age and the burden of comorbidities associated with PCOS. Results A total of 8993 women (mean [SD] age, 29.5 [6.2] years) were enrolled in this study; 196 women were already diagnosed with PCOS, 2251 were categorized as screen positive, and 6546 were categorized as screen negative. The mean (SD) age of screen-positive women (28.1 [6.4] years) was lower than that of screen-negative women (29.7 [6.1] years) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) age at menarche was higher in the former group (13.2 [1.3] vs 13.1 [1.2] years; P < .001). The national prevalence of PCOS was 7.2% (95% CI, 4.8%-10.8%) by NIH 1990 criteria, 19.6% (95% CI, 12.7%-29.2%) by Rotterdam 2003 criteria, and 13.6% (95% CI, 8.4%-21.6%) by AE-PCOS criteria. Overall, PCOS phenotypes C (501 [40.8%]) and D (301 [24.6%]) were the most common, and 492 women (pre-PCOS subgroup) had oligomenorrhea (n = 75), hyperandrogenism (n = 257), or polycystic ovarian morphology (n = 160) only. Among women with PCOS (n = 1224), obesity was present in 529 (43.2%), dyslipidemia in 1126 (91.9%), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 403 (32.9%), metabolic syndrome in 305 (24.9%), impaired glucose tolerance in 111 (9.1%), diabetes in 41 (3.3%), and hypertension in 101 (8.3%). The pre-PCOS subgroup (n = 492) displayed similar metabolic aberrations (dyslipidemia: 390 [79.3%]; metabolic syndrome: 78 [15.9%]; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: 163 [33.1%]; impaired glucose tolerance: 62 [12.6%]; diabetes: 7 [1.4%]; and hypertension: 26 [5.3%]). Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of reproductive-age women recruited across India, the prevalence of PCOS was high, with phenotype C being predominant. Most of these women had metabolic abnormalities. These findings are crucial for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies, potentially integrating PCOS management into national health programs.

AB  - RationaleArsenic-induced neurotoxicity, with dose-dependent effects, is well-documented in rodents. Curcumin (CUR), a cost-effective plant polyphenol, shows neuroprotective effects by modulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neurochemistry. This study evaluates curcumin's neuroprotective potential against arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in the mouse striatal region.MethodsHealthy adult male mice were chronically administered with varying concentrations of As2O3 (2, 4 and 8 mg/kg bw) alone and along with CUR (100 mg/kg bw) orally for 45 days. Towards the end of the experimental period, the animals were subjected to behavioural paradigms including open field task, novel object recognition, rota-rod, and Morris water maze. Striatal tissues were freshly collected from the animals on day 46 for biochemical analyses (MDA, GPx, and GSH). Additionally, perfusion-fixed brains were processed for morphological observations.ResultsBehavioural study showed an apparent decrease in certain cognitive functions (learning and memory) and locomotor activity in mice exposed to As2O3 compared to controls. Simultaneous treatment of As2O3 (2, 4 and 8 mg/kg bw) and curcumin (100 mg/kg bw) alleviated the As-induced locomotor and cognitive deficits. As2O3 alone exposure also exhibited a significant increase in oxidative stress marker (MDA) and a decrease in antioxidant enzyme levels (GPx, GSH). Morphological alterations were noted in mice subjected to elevated doses of As2O3 (4 and 8 mg/kg bw). However, these changes were reversed in mice who received As2O3 + CUR co-treatment.ConclusionsCollectively, our findings indicate that curcumin offers neuroprotection to the striatal region against As2O3-induced behavioral deficits, as well as biochemical and morphological alterations.Graphical abstractGraphical abstract illuminating the adverse effects of Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) exposure on the basal ganglia of mice along with the potential neuroprotective benefits of curcumin supplementation.

AB  - Metastatic breast-cancer is one of the major causes of death, due to remaining dormant cancer cells for several years. Rac1 is upregulated with cancer and stay elevated throughout the metastatic pathway to regulate the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. This work developed peptide FGDWS as novel inhibitor targeting Rac1-Tiam1 binding site by in-silico as it was found to be the strongest interacting peptide with Rac1 at the Tiam binding site. The binding and inhibition study of peptide with Rac1 was performed by Surface plasmon resonance and MTT assay, respectively. Cell-migration, apoptotic assay and western-blot in breast-cancer cells were performed with FGDWS and in combination with Doxorubicin (Dox). Tumor regression experiment was done with mice model. The strong binding of FGDWS with Rac1 and reduction of cell-viability were observed in breast-cancer cell-lines. The cell-migration was suppressed, and higher regression were obtained in synergy group. The apoptotic effect of FGDWS alone and with Dox were detected by annexin-V via activating caspase3/7. The tumor size was reduced by the treatment of FGDWS and more reduced in combinatorial effect. The combinatorial effect of FGDWS-Dox may enhance the treatment efficacy without side-effects.

AB  - Host-directed therapies (HDT) via modulation of specific host responses like inflammation can limit mycobacterial infection. HDTs could be included in current TB therapy as an adjunct to increase bacterial clearance and limit tissue damage to control spread. Individually, Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) and human beta defensin2 (hBD-2) are promising therapies for tuberculosis (TB). They can directly target the TB bacilli and enhance cell- mediated immune responses, which is limiting with conventional drugs. Therefore, our study investigated the combined application of MIP and hBD-2 to evaluate their efficacy in clearing infections caused by Mycobacterium smegmatis ( M.smeg ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) (both avirulent; H37Ra and virulent strain; H37Rv) in THP-1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). A strong pro-inflammatory response was observed against the combination of MIP and hBD-2 which also correlated with a significant reduction in the bacterial load. This combination further showed protection against M.tb by enhancing pyroptosis in the infected cells. The study suggests the combined use of these potent immunomodulators, which could be employed as an effective mode of therapy as adjuvants against mycobacterial infections after validation in a suitable animal model.

AB  - Since the 1940s, generalized cytotoxic therapy has been a valuable tool in cancer treatment. Over the years, there's been a significant increase in developing potential cytotoxic drugs. However, little progress has been made in enhancing patients' quality of life. The therapeutic index is limited due to the drug's poor solubility and lack of selectivity. Various carriers have been explored for drug delivery to enhance efficacy. Yet, there's a gap for a versatile delivery system that can adjust to specific drug and application requirements. Here, a multifaceted drug delivery platform based on a genetically engineered nature-inspired polymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) is introduced. This technology enables the customization of the polymeric vehicle's physicochemical characteristics to suit the needs of a specific drug and application. The review highlights ELP's advantages in cancer targeting, such as site-specificity, controlled release, biocompatibility, and extended plasma circulation. For the first time, ELP-based drug delivery into passive and active targeting for better comprehension of its adaptability is classified. Moreover, numerous opportunities for loading different types of drugs onto the polymer are outlined. Finally, the polymer's efficacy in delivery across multiple cancer types, underscoring the wide spectrum of ELP-based cancer drug delivery is precisely described.

AB  - Delta and Omicron variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are remarkably contagious, and have been recognized as variants of concern (VOC). The acquisition of spontaneous substitutions or insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in the spike protein-encoding gene substantially increases the binding affinity of the receptor binding domain (RBD)-hACE2 complex and upsurges the transmission of both variants. In this study, we analyzed thousands of genome sequences from 30 distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on the unique nucleic acid signatures in the spike gene specific to the Delta and Omicron variants. Using these variant-specific sequences, we synthesized a range of oligonucleotides and optimized a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay capable of accurately identifying and differentiating between the Delta and Omicron variants. Building on this mPCR assay, we developed a dipstick format by incorporating a tag linker sequence at the 5 ' end of the forward primer and adding biotin to the 3 ' end of the oligonucleotides, enhancing the assay's usability and accessibility. Streptavidin-coated latex beads and the dipstick imprinted with a probe for the tag linker sequence in the test strips were used for the detection assay. Our dipstick-based assay, developed as a rapid point-of-care test for identifying and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 variants has the potential to be used in low-resource settings and scaled up to the population level.

AB  - Background: The medical management of DT comprises tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), hormonal agents, anti-inflammatory drugs with the recently approved gamma secretase inhibitor nirogacestat being the current standard of care. Real-world data on evolving treatment landscapes of DT remains scarce. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with DT registered between 1995 and 2020 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and Tata Medical Center, Kolkata. Baseline characteristics were analyzed in form of median values and interquartile range. Categorical and continuous variables were compared by chi square and independent samples T- tests respectively. Anxiety, depression and QoL were prospectively measured among 30 patients using Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scales respectively between 2022 to 2023. Results: 200 patients were included with a male-predominant (n=111, 55.5%) population and median age 26.5 (2.5-75) years. Extremity (n=100, 50%) and abdomen (n=65, 32.5%) were commonest primary sites and median of 2 (1-4) lines of treatment were received. First-line included surgery (n=116, 58%), systemic therapy (n=67, 33.5%), radiotherapy (10, n=5%) and active surveillance (n=7, 3.5%). First-line systemic agents included tamoxifen (n=55, 27.5%), imatinib (n=7, 3.5%), sorafenib (n=1, 0.5%) and chemotherapy (n=4, 2%). 2019 onward, 3% and 63% underwent active surveillance and surgery respectively. Best radiological response obtained with tamoxifen was stable disease (SD) (n=76, 59%) and partial response (PR) (n=31, 24.2%). Best radiological response obtained with sorafenib was PR (n=17, 60.7%) and SD (n=9, 32.1%). Thirty patients underwent HADS and FACT-G scale assessment. Mean HADS-Anxiety subscale score was 3.6 (+/-3.9 SD) and HADS-Depression sub-scale score was 2.6 (+/-3.5 SD) with clinically significant anxiety and depression in 2 (6.7%) patients each. The overall mean FACT-G score was 87.5 (+/-12.6 SD) and lower mean physical well-being (p=0.006) and emotional well-being (0.017) scores were significantly associated with higher HADS-anxiety (>/=8) scores. Conclusions: Assessment of anxiety, depression and QoL are paramount to gauge the psychological impact of DT. This study gives an overview of clinical and management profile of patients with DT in India, with limitations of selection bias, heterogeneous population and small sample size for QoL assessment.

AB  - Objectives: In vitro activity of (3-lactam enhancer/(3-lactam combination zidebactam/cefepime was evaluated against carbapenem- and colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Methods: Non duplicate K. pneumoniae (n=185), resistant to colistin as well as non-susceptible to carbapenems were collected (2018-2019) at two large tertiary care hospitals in India. Colistin resistance-conferring genes mcr1 and mcr3 were screened among 123 of 185 randomly-selected isolates. These isolates were also subjected to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Additionally, alterations in mgrB were screened in 109 of these 123 isolates. All the study isolates were screened for presence of carbapenemases genes. MICs of zidebactam/cefepime, colistin, carbapenems, ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/relebactam, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were determined by reference CLSI broth dilution method. Results: Among the isolates, 65.4% (121/185) carried bla OXA-48-like gene and 27.6% isolates (51/185) carried dual carbapenemase genes; bla OXA-48-like and bla NDM . Of the remainder, 8 isolates carried bla NDM and 5 isolates lacked carbapenemases gene despite being carbapenem-resistant. None of the isolates showed presence of mcr1 and mcr3. Out of 109 isolates analysed for mgrB, 36 showed mutational changes. The MLST profile revealed at least 14 unique sequence types with ST231 being the dominant clone. All the isolates showed colistin MICs >2 mg/L and were non-susceptible to carbapenems. Zidebactam/cefepime demonstrated potent activity with MIC50 and MIC90 of 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively. MIC(90)s of amikacin, ceftazidime/avibactam and imipenem/relebactam were >32 mg/L. Conclusion: Zidebactam/cefepime combination was highly active against multi-clonal, carbapenem-non-susceptible and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing OXA-48-like (Ambler class D) or/and NDM (Ambler class B) carbapenemases, thus potentially offering a valuable treatment options for infections caused by such pan-drug resistant resistotypes. Though, zidebactam is not an inhibitor of class B and D (3-lactamases, potent activity of zidebactam/cefepime combination is attributable to (3-lactam enhancer mechanism.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of information on the long-term course and outcomes of bipolar disorder (BD) patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Aim: To compare the demographic and clinical profile of BD patients with and without SAD. Methodology: Data from 773 BD patients with an illness duration of at least 10 years were collected from 14 tertiary care centers. SAD was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Participants with and without SAD were compared for demographic and clinical features. Results: The prevalence of SAD was 9.44 %. BD patients with SAD spent more time in episodes (p < 0.001), had a higher number of lifetime episodes (p < 0.001), and more episodes per year of illness in the lifetime. They also spent more time in depressive episodes (p < 0.001), had higher depressive (p < 0.001) and manic (p = 0.01) affective morbidity indices, shorter durations of current remission (p < 0.001), higher levels of residual depressive and manic symptoms, higher levels of disability, and received more medications (p < 0.001). Patients with SAD were also more likely to have BD-II (p = 0.01), rapid cycling (p < 0.001), a first-lifetime episode of depressive polarity (p = 0.01), a history of breakthrough episodes (p < 0.001), self-discontinuation of pharmacoprophylaxis, and relapses due to poor medication adherence. They were more often receiving lithium, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. However, a lower proportion of those with SAD had been hospitalized, received electroconvulsive therapy, or were receiving valproate. Conclusion: Patients with SAD, in general, have more severe BD, and differ from those without SAD on many clinical parameters.

AB  - To compare the difference between primary homoeopathic and conventional paediatric care in treating acute illnesses in children in their first 24 months of life. One hundred eight Indian singleton newborns delivered at 37 to 42 weeks gestation were randomised at birth (1:1) to receive either homoeopathic or conventional primary care for any acute illness over the study period. In the homoeopathic group, conventional medical treatment was added when medically indicated. Clinicians and parents were unblinded. Children in the homoeopathic group experienced significantly fewer sick days than those in the conventional group (RR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.24-0.58; p < 0.001), with correspondingly fewer sickness episodes (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.87; p = .013), as well as fewer respiratory illnesses over the 24-month period. They were taller (F (1, 97) = 8.92, p = .004, partial eta squared = 0.84) but not heavier than their conventionally treated counterparts. They required fewer antibiotics, and their treatment cost was lower. Conclusion: Homoeopathy, using conventional medicine as a safety backdrop, was more effective than conventional treatment in preventing sick days, sickness episodes, and respiratory illnesses in the first 24 months of life. It necessitated fewer antibiotics and its overall cost was lower. This study supports homoeopathy, using conventional medicine as a safety backdrop, as a safe and cost-effective primary care modality during the first 2 years of life. Trial registration: Clinical Trial Registry-India (2018/09/015641). https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php What is Known: center dot Due to their holistic nature, many Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM) modalities are not readily amenable to assessment by head-to-head RCT for a given Indication. center dot We propose a pragmatic, RCT comparing homoeopathic with conventional medicine as a system. What is New: center dot Homoeopathic was apparently superior to conventional primary care in preventing sick days, sickness episodes, and respiratory illness episodes and was significantly associated with growth in height but not weight and required fewer antibiotics in children from birth to 24 months of age.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the molecular aberrations at 11p15.5 locus in thirty-two patients with isolated lateralized overgrowth (ILO).MethodsAmong selected 32 cases of ILO, methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) was performed initially followed by short tandem repeats (STR) marker analysis to confirm uniparental disomy (UPD). In those patients with normal MLPA reports, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C) gene and whole exome sequencing was performed.ResultsMolecular analysis by MS-MLPA showed methylation aberrations in 28% (9/32) of patients. Gain of methylation at IC1 imprinting center (H4, H7) and loss of methylation at IC2 (H6, H9) was observed in 2 patients each. Uniparental disomy was observed in 9% cases. Except one, all patients with methylation aberration had more than one limb hypertrophy. Two patients (H22/H29) also had loss of methylation at IC1. Though this molecular alteration is specifically associated with Silver Russel syndrome (SRS), but the affected children did not completely fulfill the diagnostic criteria for SRS. In a recent study, a discrepancy was reported between the diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS)/SRS and the molecular findings in the patients. Many times, it is very difficult to differentiate between hemi hypertrophy/hemi hypotrophy. Patients, in whom no aberrations were detected on MS-MLPA, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed and no pathogenic variant was identified.ConclusionsThus, ILO may be considered as a mild presentation on the extreme edge of BWS spectrum with methylation aberration and UPD in one third of cases which has implications in follow up.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough national food guides are designed, ostensibly, to translate scientific evidence with respect to food, dietary patterns, and health, their development has increasingly become a corporate/political process as well as scientific one; often with corporate/political influences overriding science. Our aim was to construct an unbiased, sustainable, evidence-informed Universal Food Guide to serve as a template for countries to develop their unique guides, thereby, provide a valid resource for health professionals, health authorities, and the public.MethodsTo address our aim, we conducted an integrative review of multiple evidence-informed sources (e.g., established databases, evidence syntheses, scholarly treatises, and policy documents) related to four areas: 1. Food guides' utility and conflicts of interest; 2. The evidence-based healthiest diet; 3. Constituents of the Universal Food Guide template; and 4. Implications for population health; regulation/governance; environment/climate/planetary health; and ethics.ResultsThe eating pattern that is healthiest for humans (i.e., most natural, and associated with maximal health across the life cycle; reduced non-communicable disease (NCD) risk; and minimal end-of-life illness) is whole food, low fat, plant-based, especially vegan, with the absence of ultra-processed food. Disparities in national food guide recommendations can be explained by factors other than science, specifically, corporate/political interests reflected in heavily government-subsidized, animal-sourced products; and trends toward dominance of daily consumption of processed/ultra-processed foods. Both trends have well-documented adverse consequences, i.e., NCDs and endangered environmental/planetary health. Commitment to an evidence-informed plant-based eating pattern, particularly vegan, will reduce risks/manifestations of NCDs; inform healthy food and nutrition policy regulation/governance; support sustainable environment/climate and planetary health; and is ethical with respect to 'best' evidence-based practice, and human and animal welfare.ConclusionThe Universal Food Guide that serves as a template for national food guides is both urgent and timely given the well-documented health-harming influences that corporate stakeholders/politicians and advisory committees with conflicts of interest, exert on national food guides. Such influence contributes to the largely-preventable NCDs and environmental issues. Policy makers, health professionals, and the public need unbiased, scientific evidence as informed by the Universal Food Guide, to inform their recommendations and choices.

AB  - The WNT/(3-catenin is among one of the most extensively studied cellular signaling pathways involved in the initiation and progression of several deadly cancers. It is now understood that the WNT/(3-catenin signaling, during tumor progression operates in a very complex fashion beyond the earlier assumed simple WNT 'On' or 'Off' mode as it recruits numerous WNT ligands, receptors, transcriptional factors and also cross-talks with other signaling molecules including the noncanonical WNT regulators. WNT/(3-catenin signaling molecules are often mutated in different cancers which makes them very challenging to inhibit and sometimes ranks them among the undruggable targets. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary conservation of this pathway, inhibiting WNT/ (3-catenin has caused significant toxicity in normal cells. These challenges are reflected in clinical trial data, where the use of WNT/(3-catenin inhibitors as standalone treatments remains limited. In this review, we have highlighted the crucial functional associations of diverse WNT/(3-catenin signaling regulators with cancer progression and the phenotypic switching of tumor cells. Next, we have shed light on the roles of WNT/(3-catenin signaling in drug resistance, clonal evolution, tumor heterogeneity, and immune evasion. The present review also focuses on various classes of routine and novel WNT/(3-catenin therapeutic regimes while addressing the challenges associated with targeting the regulators of this complex pathway. In the light of multiple case studies on WNT/(3-catenin inhibitors, we also highlighted the challenges and opportunities for future clinical trial strategies involving these treatments. Additionally, we have proposed strategies for future WNT/(3-catenin-based drug discovery trials, emphasizing the potential of combination therapies and AI/ML-driven prediction approaches. Overall, here we showcased the opportunities, possibilities, and potentialities of WNT/(3-catenin signaling modulatory therapeutic regimes as promising precision cancer medicines for the future.

AB  - Background Bilateral ocular surface disease resulting from Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and chemical injuries are visually debilitating and difficult to treat. Ocular surface reconstruction by various means has been reported with variable results. This study addresses an unmet need for a prospective clinical trial comparing the outcomes of transplanting autologous oral and conjunctival epithelial cell constructs on human amniotic membrane by ex vivo tissue engineering. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial was prospectively applied for registration, with the clinical trial registry of India (CTRI), with the approval of the Institute Ethics Committee number IEC/NP-99/11.04.2014 and CTRI No. REF/2018/10/021791, the study also registered with the WHO-recognized trial registry, International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registration reference number 45780. The study was conducted to compare clinical outcomes of two different tissue-engineered cell grafts, Cultivated Oral Mucosal Epithelial Transplantation (COMET) and Conjunctival Cultivated Epithelial Transplantation (CCET) for ocular surface reconstruction in patients with bilateral ocular surface disease due to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or chemical injuries. Fifty patients were enrolled and randomized to either the COMET or CCET group. A uniform pre-op and post-op protocol using standard medications was followed for all patients Parameters assessed at baseline, day 1, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively included patient comfort, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ocular surface status and corneal clarity. The efficacy was measured in terms of improvement of vision, reduction in vascularization, symblepharon and corneal clarity. Results In the study, 50 patients (50 eyes; mean ages of 29 +/- 15.86 years and 26.36 +/- 10.85 years, respectively; range, 12-65 years) were enrolled, with 25 patients each in the COMET and CCET groups. Out of them, 36% were female and 64% were male; the causes were Steven Johnson syndrome (48), and chemical injury (2). Mean pre-operative BCVA was log MAR 1.73 +/- 0.57 for COMET and 1.99 +/- 0.33 for the CCET group. Pre-operatively all 50 enrolled patients had opaque corneas pre-operatively, symblepharon that extended to the cornea categorised as grade 3 and corneal vascularization that went beyond the pupil's boundary into the central zone encluaching on the visual axis. The minimal follow-up time was six months. Following surgery postoperatively, the BCVA considerably improved in the COMET group by 1.51 +/- 0.58 compared to the CCET group by 1.91 +/- 0.33 at 3 months. BCVA at 6 months was 1.73 +/- 0.56 in the COMET group and 1.99 +/- 0.31 in the CCET group, which is not statistically significant and comparable to the BCVA before surgery. The corneal clarity was significantly improved in COMET group 25 eye (100%) at 2 month, 3month and 19 eye (76%), 6eye (24%) at 6 months when compared to CCET group 15 eye improved (60%), 9 eyes (36%) not improved and one eye with opaque cornea (4%) at 2 months. 22 eye (88%) had not improved, 2 eye (8%) opaque cornea and 1 eye (4%) improved at 3 months. At 6 months 21 eye (84%) were not improved, 4 eye (16%) eye became opaqued at 6 months. Compared to preoperative conditions, both groups had improved corneal clarity significantly (p > 0.005).
   Of the 50 patients with grade 3 symblepharon extended to the cornea, were completely resolved 19 (76%) in COMET group when compared to CCET group 22 eye (88%) not improved. Similarly, 19 eye (76%) had a improvement in corneal vascularization when compared to the CCET group not improved 25 eye (100%) at 6months. No adverse event was observed in any of either group during the follow up periods. Conclusion Both cell types are effective to restore the ocular surface integrity in bilateral ocular surface disease. Whereas COMET is safe and efficacious in terms of improvement of clinical parameters including, BCVA, corneal clarity, reduction in vascularization and preventing the recurrence of symblepharon postoperatively 3months and 6 months. In addition, the CCET group maintained the stability of the ocular surface and had improvement in corneal clarity and a decrease in vascularization at 3 months compared to their pre-operative characteristics.

AB  - Background Heart failure affects almost 64 million people, with more than half of it constituting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) are in the first line for HFrEF, but no head-to-head trials are available. Moreover, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) has been demonstrated as a promising prognostic marker, specifically for HFrEF, but has not been explored much. Methods This pragmatic randomised controlled trial recruits 100 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction <40%) of New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III and allocates them in a 1:1 ratio to the dapagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan groups. The primary objective is to assess the difference in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide serum levels at the end of 16 weeks. The secondary efficacy objectives are to assess GDF-15, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-overall summary score and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients will be assessed at baseline, fourth week and 16th week after randomisation. As health technology assessment practices widely differ in countries, cost assessment is a vital factor to consider. The cost needed to treat one cardiovascular event is also compared between both groups. The occurrence of safety events will also be evaluated at each follow-up point. Conclusion This pragmatic study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFrEF in real-world settings. The study aims to provide clinicians with data to make informed decisions regarding the preferred drug class. Additionally, examining the impact of ARNI and SGLT2i on GDF-15 levels could offer better insights into prognosis among patients with HFrEF. Ethics and dissemination This study involves human participants and was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee at AlIMS Jodhpur with reference number AIIMS/IEC/2023/5842 approved this study. Participants gave informed consent to participate in the study before taking part. The research findings will be disseminated via closed group discussions at the site of study, scientific conferences, peer-reviewed published manuscripts, and social media.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical threat to global public health, necessitating the development of novel strategies. AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve to resist antimicrobial drugs, making infections difficult to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death. Over 70% of infection-causing microorganisms are estimated to be resistant to one or several antimicrobial drugs. AMR mechanisms include efflux pumps, target modifications (e.g., mutations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), ribosomal subunits, or DNA gyrase), drug hydrolysis by enzymes (e.g., beta-lactamase), and membrane alterations that reduce the antibiotic's binding affinity and entry. Microbes also resist antimicrobials through peptidoglycan precursor modification, ribosomal subunit methylation, and alterations in metabolic enzymes. Rapid development of new strategies is essential to curb the spread of AMR and microbial infections. Nanomedicines, with their small size and unique physicochemical properties, offer a promising solution by overcoming drug resistance mechanisms such as reduced drug uptake, increased efflux, biofilm formation, and intracellular bacterial persistence. They enhance the therapeutic efficacy of antimicrobial agents, reduce toxicity, and tackle microbial resistance effectively. Various nanomaterials, including polymeric-based, lipid-based, metal nanoparticles, carbohydrate-derived, nucleic acid-based, and hydrogels, provide efficient solutions for AMR. This review addresses the epidemiology of microbial resistance, outlines key resistance mechanisms, and explores how nanomedicines overcome these barriers. In conclusion, nanomaterials represent a versatile and powerful approach to combating the current antimicrobial crisis.

AB  - IntroductionHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe and rapidly progressive immune disorder that can be life threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The HLH2004 guidelines, originally devised for the diagnosis of HLH in pediatric subjects, lack due utility in the adult population. Despite the development of the H-score and adapted HLH 2004 criteria, a critical gap remains in their validation and optimization for diverse populations, including the Indian adult population.MethodsIn this prospective observational study, clinical data of 120 patients with suspected HLH were collected. The utility of the H-score and the adapted HLH 2004 for the diagnosis of HLH in adults was studied with respect to expert consensus. The best cut-off value of the calculated H-score for the diagnosis of HLH in our set up was studied using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsOf 120 adult inpatients suspected of having HLH, 66 were diagnosed with HLH, 37 did not have HLH, and 17 had undetermined status based on expert consensus. Infections were the most common underlying cause, present in 60% of the cases, followed by malignancies (15%). The adapted HLH 2004 criteria demonstrated higher sensitivity (90.9%) but lower specificity (86.5%) compared to the H-Score at the standard cut-off of 169, which had a sensitivity of 81.82% and specificity of 94.59%. ROC curve analysis identified an optimal H-score cut-off of 145, improving the sensitivity to 92.4% and specificity to 89.2%.ConclusionOur study highlights the importance of region-specific diagnostic criteria for HLH in adults, particularly in settings where infection is prevalent. By optimizing the H-score cut-off to 145, we improved the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in our cohort. These findings support the need for tailored diagnostic tools to enhance HLH detection in diverse populations.

AB  - Introduction Kuwait has a large expatriate community who experience both restricted access to public health services and lower income than Kuwaiti citizens. Given these conditions, we examined differences in characteristics and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) between Kuwaitis and expatriates. Methods Clinical and laboratory data for adult CKD Stages 3-5 not on dialysis (CKD 3-5 ND) patients with native kidneys attending nephrology clinics in all Ministry of Health hospitals collected from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. Cohort was then divided into Kuwaiti patients and expatriates patients for comparison. Results We collected data from 2,610 patients (eGFR: 30.8 ml/min/1.73m(2); age: 62.6 years; males: 56.7%; Kuwaitis: 62.1%). Kuwaitis were older (63.94 vs. 60.3 years, p < 0.001), with lower mean eGFR (30.4 vs. 31.5 ml/min/1.73m(2), p = 0.052) than non-Kuwaitis, however, Kuwaitis had lower mean blood pressure (137.2/76.5 vs. 139.1/78.9 mmHg, p = 0.006), lower HbA1c in diabetics (7.59 vs. 7.82%, p = 0.010), and better lipid profile despite higher body mass indexes (29.6 vs. 28.9 kg/m(2), p = 0.002). Both groups had high diabetes mellitus and hypertension rates. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were used in only 22.6% and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) in only 46.2%. Conclusion CKD 3-5 ND is caused by diabetes mellitus in 56.6% of cases, and the majority have hypertension. In our study, non-Kuwaitis had higher eGFR; however, restricted public healthcare access and lower income can lead to an unhealthy diet and suboptimal care, which may cause higher blood pressure, higher HbA1c, and a higher dyslipidemia rate. RAASi and SGLT2i utilization must increase to combat CKD, and antihypertensive selection must improve.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers affecting females worldwide. Several new effective therapeutic strategies are being developed to minimize the number of breast cancer-related deaths and improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients. However, resistance to conventional therapies in breast cancer patients remains a challenge which could be due to several reasons, including changes in the tumor microenvironment. Attention is being diverted towards minimizing the resistance, toxicity, and improving the affordability of therapeutics for better breast cancer management. This includes personalized medicine, target-specific drug delivery systems, combinational therapies and artificial intelligence based screening and disease prediction. Nowadays, researchers and clinicians are also exploring the use of combinatorial immunotherapies in breast cancer patients, which have shown encouraging results in terms of improved survival outcomes. This study attempts to analyze the role of combinational immunotherapies in breast cancer patients, and offer insights into their effectiveness in breast cancer management. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for which we selected the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focused on completed Phase I/II/III/IV clinical trials investigating combination immunotherapies for breast cancer. The analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of combination therapies in comparison to mono-therapies, focusing on overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: We observed that, combination immunotherapies significantly (P<0.05) improved OS as compared to single-drug therapies in the Phase I with overall Risk ratio (RR) of 16.17 (CI 2.23,117.50), Phase II with an overall RR of 19.19 (CI 11.76,31.30) and for phase III overall RR 22.27 (CI 13.60,36.37). In the case of PFS, it was significant with RR: 12.35 (CI 2.14, 71.26) in Phase I RR 6.10 (CI 4.31, 8.64) in phase II, RR 8.95 (CI 6.09, 13.16) in phase III and RR 14.82 (CI 6.49, 33.82) in Phase IV of clinical trials. Conclusion: The observed improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival suggest that combination immunotherapies could serve as a better approach to breast cancer management.

AB  - Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN characterized by reciprocal translocation in the ABL1 and BCR region of chromosomes 9 and 22 respectively. Progression to the blast phase in chronic myeloid leukemia results in a poorer prognosis. It can be of either myeloid, lymphoid or a mixed lineage. Progression to the promyelocytic blast phase is very rare, and there are no evidence-based guidelines for its management. Thrombosis in CML is not well defined. Thrombosis can be seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with venous thrombosis (VTE) being more common than arterial thrombosis. Ischemic stroke as the presenting feature of blast phase progression in CML is extremely rare. We report a case of CML who presented to us with acute ischemic stroke and subsequently was diagnosed as CML transformed to the promyelocytic blast phase. She was successfully treated with dasatinib along with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO).

AB  - Incidence of trauma is on the rise all over the world. Timely management of trauma patients is necessary to reduce both mortality and morbidity. Trauma care is provided in a wide range of health care facilities ranging from district hospitals to trauma centres, the latter of which have the resources and capabilities necessary to provide specialised trauma services. The Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGME&R) is a medical college in Eastern India with a functioning trauma centre since 2019. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between opening a dedicated trauma centre and outcomes in critically ill patients. We analysed data of critically ill trauma patients aged at least 18 years. We compared patient mortality before the trauma centre opened (from January 2016 to June 2019) and after the trauma centre opened (from July 2019 to December 2022). We included a total of 1487 patients. Before the trauma centre opened, 487 critically ill trauma patients were included, with a 35% survival rate. After it opened, 1000 patients were included, and the survival rate increased to 65%. The opening of a trauma centre was associated with a dramatic effect on survival in critically ill trauma patients. Trial registration number NCT02838459 (July 2016) NCT03235388 (August 2017).

AB  - Astroblastoma, a unique entity of glial tumor, predominantly occur in young women with distinctive MN1 rearrangement, Given its limited documentation in existing literature, we report eight cases of astroblastoma, detailing their clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics along with molecular analysis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of our neuropathology archive database spanning the past 8 years. We included all cases that underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), surgical resection, histopathological examination, molecular testing, and follow-up. Histopathological examination involving immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) was carried out for all cases. All tumors were found to be located in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemisphere). The median age of the group was 35.1 years, with a female- to-male ratio of 1.6:1. The most common clinical presentation was headache. Morphologically, all tumors exhibited astroblastic features with pseudorosettes and perivascular hyalinization. Immunohistochemistry consistently revealed positivity for EMA and variable immunoreactivity for GFAP, OLIG2, and D2-40. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis conducted for all cases showed MN1 rearrangement in 7 cases. The mean follow-up period was 45 months (ranging from 12 to 105 months). Radiotherapy was administered for high-grade and recurrent astroblastomas. All patients are currently alive and in good health. Astroblastomas are uncommon central nervous system (CNS) tumors with characteristics morphology and molecular signatures. They typically carry a favorable prognosis. High level suspicion is required for their diagnosis and molecular analysis is must to distinguish them from other morphological mimics.

AB  - ObjectivesThe parasternal intercostal muscle activity, a marker of accessory muscle usage, is found to correlate inversely with the pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm and level of support of mechanical ventilation. The primary objective of our study was to determine whether the parasternal intercostal muscle thickening fraction (PMTF) measured by ultrasonography can predict weaning. We also evaluated whether addition of lung ultrasound score and echocardiographic assessment can add on to predicting weaning failure.MethodsThis prospective observational study conducted in a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit, included 60 adult patients who were eligible for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) after being invasively mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours. Ultrasound of respiratory muscles, lung parenchyma, and echocardiographic assessment were performed before and after 120 minutes of SBT. Parasternal intercostal muscles were imaged with a high frequency linear probe on the right second intercostal space 5 cm lateral to the sternal margin. PMTF was calculated as (maximum-minimum thickness)/minimum thickness.ResultsAmong 60 patients, SBT failure was seen in 11 patients and extubation failed in 8 patients. PMTF (%) was significantly higher in the weaning failure group (13.33 [8.33-19.05]) as compared to patients with successful weaning (6.67 [6.06-11.54]). Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) correlated inversely to PMTF in patients with weaning failure. A pre-SBT PMTF cut-off of >= 7.7% and post-SBT cut-off of >= 15.38% were good predictors of weaning failure and extubation failure, respectively.ConclusionsPMTF has good discriminatory power to predict weaning outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.74 [0.59-0.88]). Pre-SBT PMTF had similar power as DTF to predict weaning failure.

AB  - Objective: Tooth bleaching procedures on nonvital teeth have been performed for crown discoloration caused by regenerative endodontic therapy (RET). However, leakage of bleaching agents across the root canal can be detrimental. This study aimed to assess and compare the penetration levels of hydrogen peroxide (HP) from different bleaching agents across calcium silicate-based coronal barriers in immature permanent teeth. Methods: Fifty extracted single-rooted human teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10): Group I (HH)-35% hydrogen peroxide (HP); Group II (SS)-a mixture of sodium perborate (SP) powder and saline; Group III (SH)-a mixture of SP powder and 30% HP liquid; Group IV (CP)-10% carbamide peroxide gel. The control group (Group V, CC) was treated with distilled water. The bleaching agent was replaced on the 4th day, and penetration analysis was performed on the 7th day using ferro thiocyanate (FTC) method and a UV-spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 480 nm. Results: Compared with the control group, the SH group (SP mixed with HP) showed a significant difference, indicating substantial HP penetration across the root canal space (p value < 0.0001). Intergroup comparisons also revealed a significant difference between the SS and SH groups (p value < 0.0001), suggesting that the SS group had less penetration. Conclusion: Compared with other bleaching agents, SP mixed with saline/water resulted in the lowest HP penetration in the pulp canals of the RET-simulated tooth models.

AB  - Introduction: Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy causing developmental defects and progressive retinal dystrophy, whereas choroidal coloboma is a developmental defect causing structural deficiency in the posterior retina. Both are rarely reported together. Methods: Here, we describe the phenotype and genotype of three unrelated patients with co-occurrence of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome and chorioretinal coloboma and review the pertinent literature. Results: We describe three unrelated patients, with variable clinical features of Bardet Biedl syndrome. None had family history of BBS or coloboma. Each carried biallelic variants in BBS1, BBS9 and TTC8 gene, respectively. Two had unilateral chorioretinal coloboma, while one had bilateral chorioretinal coloboma. Discussion: Although there may be other explanatory factors yet to be revealed, our data suggests that chorioretinal coloboma may be associated with BBS. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, an intercellular communicator for development of the eye, is dependent on the primary cilia and plays a crucial role in the closure of the optic fissure. Both disorders therefore involve disruption of primary cilia function which may explain their association.

AB  - Objectives: Assessment of diabetes-specific knowledge among children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their caregivers using a validated diabetes knowledge test (DKT) and to determine the factors associated with DKT score. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, New Delhi (India). Children 5-18 years with T1D and caregivers were evaluated using a validated DKT tool to assess knowledge in basic and advance domains. The factors associated with DKT scores were studied. Results: 110 T1D children with mean (SD) age 12.2 (3.3) years and duration 5.3 (2.7) years were assessed. The mean (SD) composite DKT score (%) was 58.0 (11.1) while in basic and advance domains were 66.4 (9.5) and 50.4(1.5), respectively. Maternal education (>= graduate), socio-economic strata (>= upper middle), annual per capita income (>Rs 50,000/700 USD), urban setting and HbA1c<8.5 % were significantly associated with higher odds of DKT score>50 %. HbA1c<8.5 % and urban setting were significant predictors of the DKT score on multivariate logistic regression analysis (p<0.001). Conclusions: DKT can identify individual challenges in specific (basic or advance) domains related to diabetes self-management skills. Higher maternal education significantly impacted achieving a high DKT score and improved glycemic control.

Secondary: To study correlation of inflammatory markers, Erythrocyte sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with disease status.MethodsProspective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care hospital over two years (2021-2023) consisted 28 patients with NOE. Treatment culmination point was decided based on symptoms control and correlated with PET-scan findings. Clinical response was analysed with respect to the serum inflammatory markers and PET Scan findings.ResultsThere was fair degree of agreement between clinical resolution and resolution of findings on PET scan (kappa coefficient - 0.76 [95% CI; 0.40,1.00]). Inflammatory markers showed statistically significant decline with clinical resolution but failed to return to normal.ConclusionDecision to terminate treatment of NOE can be reliably made on clinical grounds in patients remaining asymptomatic for three weeks. Resolution of inflammation on PET scan is in congruity with the clinical remission .

AB  - Assessment of the true impact of therapeutic interventions is a challenge in the absence of universal, standardized definitions for clinical trial endpoints in children with kidney diseases. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a difficult kidney disease to treat, with unremitting disease progressing to kidney failure. Currently, available therapies result in suboptimal cure rates. Clinical trials with innovative, targeted treatments will likely be conducted for this disease in the foreseeable future. An international consortium of the IPNA Best Practices and Standards Committee and the Pediatric Nephrology Expert Group of the conect4children (c4c) network developed through consensus, standardized, internationally acceptable definitions for trial outcomes for SRNS. The endpoint definitions were formulated for use with urine protein to creatinine ratios and estimated glomerular filtration rates. Definitions of complete remission, partial remission, non-remission of disease, reduction in proteinuria, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and composite kidney outcome were refined using an iterative process until a consensus was achieved.

KW  - ETIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: This prospective study evaluated the effect of immediate functional loading (IFL) of a full-coverage prosthesis on the clinical and radiographic outcome of nonsurgical endodontic therapy (NSET) performed on mandibular molar teeth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis. Methods: In 20 subjects, standardized 2-visit NSET was performed in bilateral mandibular first molar teeth (split-mouth model) with a diagnosis of pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis exhibiting a radiographic periapical index (PAI) score >= 3. In each subject, the nonvital bilateral mandibular first molar teeth were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the IFL group or the functional loading after a time interval of 6 months group. Provisional full-coverage prostheses were provided within 7 days after the completion of endodontic therapy. The cases were followed up clinically and radiographically at 6 and 12 months. Radiographs were assessed for periapical healing based on PAI scores, which were dichotomized as healed (PAI score <= 2) or nonhealed (PAI score >= 3). The data were compared using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Results: A recall rate of 100% was achieved at the end of 12 months. All teeth in the IFL group and the functional loading after a time interval of 6 months group were clinically asymptomatic. According to an intergroup comparison between the proportion of teeth healed and nonhealed (radiographic), there was a significant difference (P < .05). Conclusions: IFL of a full-coverage prosthesis in endodontically treated mandibular molar teeth with pulp necrosis and asymptomatic apical periodontitis delayed periapical healing.

AB  - Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is one of the most common urological abnormalities in infants and children. The association of VUR, urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal parenchymal damage is well established. The most serious complications of VUR-associated reflux nephropathy are hypertension and proteinuria with chronic kidney disease. Over the past two decades, our understanding of the natural history of VUR has improved, which has helped to identify patients at increased risk of both VUR and VUR-associated renal injury. The main goals in the treatment of paediatric patients with VUR are the prevention of recurrent UTIs and minimizing the risk of renal scarring and long-term renal impairment. Currently, there are four options for managing primary VUR in infants and children: surveillance or intermittent treatment of UTIs with management of bladder and bowel dysfunction; continuous antibiotic prophylaxis; endoscopic subureteral injection of tissue-augmenting substances; and ureteral reimplantation via open, laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. Current debates regarding key aspects of management include when to perform diagnostic imaging and how to best identify the paediatric patients that will benefit from continuous antibiotic prophylaxis or surgical intervention, including endoscopic injection therapy and minimally invasive ureteral reimplantation. Evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence, have the potential to assist clinicians in the decision-making process and in the individualization of diagnostic imaging and treatment of infants and children with VUR in the future.
   Primary vesicoureteral reflux is the most common urological abnormality in infants and children and its association with urinary tract infection and renal parenchymal damage is well established. In this Primer, Puri and colleagues review the current classifications, epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnosis and management of this disorder and highlight open research questions.

AB  - Cancer is a significant worldwide health concern that requires effective therapies. Addressing this critical issue necessitates innovative treatment strategies concentrating on the fundamental causes of cancer progression. The PARP15 protein is essential in cancer progression by facilitating DNA repair pathways, making it a promising target for anti-cancer therapies. This investigation relies on computational strategies, including virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations, to identify potential inhibitors of PARP15 target protein. Three potential compounds (26646684, 104224077, and 17505556) with notable binding affinities and interaction patterns were selected for further investigation. Compound 17505556 shows significant interactions, suggesting more stable conformation throughout the simulation against the target protein. Compound 17505556 exhibited the highest binding free energy (-34.07 kcal/mol), significantly outperforming the reference inhibitor I4X (-26.70 kcal/mol). This strong binding affinity suggests that 17505556 forms stable and sustained interactions with PARP15, making it the most promising inhibitor among those studied. Other compounds, 26646684 (-28.92 kcal/mol) and 104224077 (-26.83 kcal/mol), also demonstrated favorable binding energies, indicating their potential as viable inhibitors. The overall result of the investigation suggests the compound 17505556 as a possible drug candidate for the inhibition of DNA repair protein, offering novel avenues for developing an anti-cancer drug candidate.

AB  - Reliable estimation of pulse oximetry (SpO2) is indispensable in a neonatal intensive care setting. Along with clinical examination, SpO2 is a validated non-invasive correlate of PaO2 to dictate the level of respiratory support. Any alterations that may interfere with this correlation pose significant challenges and lead to inadvertent over- or under-treatment. The authors report a case with an unusual discrepancy between SpO2 and PaO2 in a neonate with jaundice who developed bronze baby syndrome while receiving phototherapy. A review of similar previous reports suggests that abnormal pigment accumulation in bronze baby syndrome may render pulse oximetry transiently unreliable.

AB  - Mitochondrial disorders are a diverse group of diseases caused by mutations in genes encoded by either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. In a group of patients with nuclear mitochondriopathies, the authors analysed the clinico-radiological and genotypic spectrum. The study included 25 patients with a genetic diagnosis of nuclear mitochondrial cytopathy who were seen over a 5 y period. There were 25 patients in the study cohort (Mean age of presentation- 14 mo). Biallelic mutations involving nuclear mitochondrial genes were identified in all 25 of them. In 13 and 9 patients, respectively, respiratory chain defects (complex I and complex IV) and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes were identified. Twelve novel variants were identified. Interestingly, NDUFV1 with a south Indian founder variant c.1156 C > T (p.Arg386Cys) was the commonest variant. Accurate phenotyping combined with next generation sequencing aids in the precise diagnosis of mitochondrial nuclear gene defects and provides the opportunity for appropriate counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feasibility and safety of endoscopic endonasal approaches have become well established, and focus has now shifted to minimizing nasal morbidity. To this end, several modifications in the nasal stage have been described that focus primarily on preservation of nasal mucosa on right side of the nasal cavity. However, nasal mucosal preservation on the left side of the nasal cavity has largely been ignored. This technical note describes a modified technique that can eliminate mucosal damage in the left nasal cavity. METHODS: A transseptal approach is used on the left, and an endonasal approach is used on the right side. A hemitransfixion incision is used to raise the left submucosal tunnel. The mucosa of the tunnel lies laterally in apposition with the lateral nasal wall, thereby protecting it from injury by repeated passage of instruments. When the tunnel mucosa is pushed back medially, the left nasal cavity appears absolutely normal without any evidence of mucosal damage. RESULTS: Combined endonasal and transseptal technique for the nasal stage was performed in 51 patients with sellar/suprasellar lesions. Nonfunctional pituitary adenomas were the most common pathology (macroadenomas: n = 14; giant adenomas: n = 10) followed by functional adenomas (acromegaly: n = 10; prolactinomas: n = 3; Cushing disease: n = 1), craniopharyngiomas (n n = 6), clival tumors (n n = 5), and tuberculum sellae meningiomas (n n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of endonasal and transseptal approaches uses the advantages of both endoscopic and microscopic approaches sans the disadvantage of restricted space seen in microscopic approaches. It makes the binostril approach least disruptive to the left nasal mucosa and thus can reduce overall morbidity of endoscopic endonasal approaches.

AB  - Background: Various types of needles are available to perform endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). A relatively new needle for EBUS-TBNA, the Acquire Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) device, has recently become available. Methods: Consecutive subjects with lymphadenopathy >1 cm undergoing EBUS-TBNA were randomized to the Acquire 22-G EBUS-FNB needle and the standard 22-G EBUS-TBNA needle groups. Results: A total of 86 subjects were randomized (43 in each group). The diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA was similar between the two groups: (36/43) 83.7% in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group and (34/43) 79.1% in the standard 22-G EBUS group (p = 0.58). The sampling adequacy, stations sampled, number of stations sampled, number of needle passes, and mean duration of the procedure between the two groups were also similar. Visible tissue clot core was obtained in a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group (93.0% vs 46.5%, p < 0.001). Visibly bloody samples were more frequent in the 22-G EBUS-FNB group (74.4% vs 51.2%, p = 0.03). There was no difference in the complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.15). Conclusion: We did not observe a difference in the diagnostic yield of the Acquire 22-G EBUS-FNB needle compared with the standard 22-G EBUS needle.

AB  - Asthma and related respiratory symptoms are growing in India and urban cities are experiencing increasing traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) levels. Our study investigates the association between TRAP and respiratory symptoms, and unplanned visits made to general practitioner/ emergency department/hospital admission in children and adolescents; we also aimed to understand whether low greenspaces surrounding the schools impacted this association. Trucks passing near the child's residences were used as a surrogate marker for measuring exposure to heavy TRAP. Exposures to school neighbourhood characteristics such as distance from major roads, a major source of TRAP, and industries were studied and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to measure greenspaces at 100 m and 200 m.

AB  - Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogenous group of inherited disorder, and its progression not only affects the retina but also the primary visual cortex. This manifests imbalances in the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, we investigated if changes in cortical functioning is linked to alterations in GABAergic population of neurons and its two important subsets, somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) neuron in rd1 model of retinal degeneration (RD). We demonstrate marked decrease in the proportion of SST neurons in different layers of cortex whereas PV neurons were less affected. Moreover, we found reduced expression of glutamatergic thalamic afferents (VGLUT2) due to lack of visual activity. These results suggest PV neurons are likely recruited by the cortical circuitry to increase the inhibitory drive and compensate the disrupted inhibition-excitation balance. However, reduced SST expression perhaps results in weakening of stimulus selectivity. Delineating their functional role during RD will provide insights for acquisition of high-resolution vision thereby improving current state of vision restoration.

AB  - There is a paucity of literature regarding the effect of anesthetic techniques on antitumor immunity, especially in gall bladder malignancies. We designed a study to compare the effect of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia and sevoflurane-based general anesthesia-on antitumor immunity, including tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), T-helper cell profile, and inflammatory markers. A pilot prospective randomized trial was conducted in 64 patients undergoing surgery for gall bladder malignancy under general anesthesia in a tertiary specialty cancer hospital. Adult cancer patients of ASA physical status I-III fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized to either group S (sevoflurane-based general anesthesia) or group T (propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia). Preoperative (morning of surgery) and postoperative (24 h and 1 month after surgery) blood samples were obtained. Demographic profile and preoperative parameters were comparable between both groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the postoperative value of TGF-beta (higher in group T). There was a statistically significant difference in postoperative interleukin-17A value (indicative of TH17 cells), and it was found to be higher in group S. Propofol-based TIVA increases serum TGF-beta levels. At the same time, Sevoflurane modulates T-helper cells-based immunity to increase TH17 cells in patients with gall bladder cancer. Multiple larger studies will be required to validate the results and provide useful recommendations.

AB  - Background: India currently accounts for a majority of global suicide deaths. Research in European ancestry has established that suicide mortality has a significant genetic component, and suggests that inflammation may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of suicide. Inflammation is also highly relevant in regions of increased pollution exposure, such as the megacities of India. To address the existing gaps in genetic research on suicide and possible association with inflammatory biomarkers, we examined genetic polymorphism and clinical risk phenotypes in a population-based suicide-death cohort, India. Material and methods: Genotyping of IL-1 beta(rs16944) & (rs1143627), IL-4(rs2070874), IL-6(rs1800795) and IL-10(rs1800896) was done in 234 post-mortem suicide-death cases and 256 post-mortem controls (N = 490) using PCR RFLP method. Results: Our analyses identified three significant (p < 0.001) associations of cytokine variants with suicide death, including IL-1 beta(rs16944), OR = 0.627; IL-4(rs2070874), OR = 0.524; and IL-6(rs1800795), OR = 2.509. Cases were more likely female and were more likely to have a history of psychiatric illness, though rate of psychiatric illness was low in suicide cases(9%). Conclusion: Our genetic results are generally consistent with previous research on risk for depression and suicidal behaviour, and both genetic and phenotypic results provide new insights into risk factors that may contribute to suicide in India.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to explore the factors that could predict long term clinical outcomes in SA. Methods A retrospective study was conducted wherein SA patients undergoing surgical resection with a minimum follow up of 12 months were included in this study. Modified Mccormick Scale (MMS) was utilized to record the neurological status of the patients both preoperatively and at last follow up. Outcomes were assessed as: long term neurological status, that is final MMS grade and neurological deterioration, defined as increase in MMS score as compared to preoperative MMS score. Survival analysis was performed using the kaplan meier curves. Results 71 patients were included in this study with mean age of 33.07years. At a mean follow up of 57 months, preoperative MMS was the single independent predictor for moderate-severe neurological deficit (MMS III to V) on multivariate analysis (OR: 30.2, p < 0.001) and had an outstanding AUC of 0.91. Six patients had neurological deterioration at long term follow up. Absence of spasticity (p = 0.028), thoracic-thoracolumbar tumors (p = 0.006), low MMS score (p = 0.01) and hypointense T1 weighted MRI (p = 0.009) were significant predictors of long term neurological deterioration. The median overall survival was 48 months and was significantly higher in low grade tumors (p < 0.001). Conclusion The study highlights the efficacy of clinical features as a predictor of long term functional outcomes in SA patients. Role of spasticity as a prognostic factor was explored for the first time in this study.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of chronic fluoride exposure on the absorption of essential minerals in the gut and explores the mechanisms underlying mineral deficiencies due to fluoride ingestion. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (G-1) served as the control (non-fluoride exposed), while group 2 (G-2) and group 3 (G-3) received human equivalent doses (HED) of fluoride (50 and 100 ppm ad libitum, corresponding to 5 and 10 ppm in humans, respectively) for 75 days. Serum fluoride concentrations were measured, and the levels of essential minerals and trace elements in blood and stool were analyzed using ICP-MS. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on stool samples to identify chemical compounds. The chemical compounds and macromolecular complexes containing fluoride and essential minerals were identified and quantified using Match3 software. Results indicated that the blood concentrations of essential minerals were significantly lower (p <= 0.05) in the fluoride-exposed groups compared to the control, while excretion of essential elements in stool was significantly higher (p <= 0.05) in the fluoride-administered groups. XRD analysis revealed the formation of unusual macromolecular chemical complexes in the stool of fluoride-treated groups, with the types and concentrations of these compounds increasing with higher fluoride doses. The study concludes that fluoride in the stomach chelates minerals, reducing their absorption, and induces the formation of unusual high molecular weight macromolecular chelation complexes, which alter the chemical species in the gut and further impair the absorption of essential minerals.

T2  - NEUROLOGY

KW  - ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE
KW  - SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT
KW  - ALTEPLASE
AB  - Objectives
   Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) accounts for 25% of ischemic strokes in young adults. This study evaluated the benefits and harms of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients presenting with spontaneous CeAD and acute ischemic stroke symptoms.
   Methods
   This analysis used data from the retrospective STOP-CAD study and included patients with spontaneous CeAD who presented within 1 day of acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Patients were dichotomized into those who received IVT and those managed without IVT. We assessed the association between IVT and 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2) and the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH, defined as ICH causing new or worsening neurologic symptoms within 72 hours after CeAD diagnosis).
   Results
   This study included 1,653 patients from the original STOP-CAD cohort of 4,023. The median age was 49 years, and 35.1% were women; 512 (31.0%) received IVT. IVT was associated with 90-day functional independence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.67, 95% CI 1.23-2.28, p = 0.001), but not with symptomatic ICH (aOR = 1.52, 95% CI 0.79-2.92, p = 0.215).
   Discussion
   In patients with spontaneous CeAD and suspected ischemic stroke, IVT improved functional outcomes, without increasing symptomatic ICH risk. These findings support current guideline recommendations to consider thrombolysis for otherwise eligible patients with CeAD.
   Classification of Evidence
   This study provides Class III evidence that IVT significantly increases the probability of 90-day functional independence in patients with CeAD.

AB  - Background: The ACR in 2021 and the EULAR in 2022 published recommendations for management of ANCAassociated vasculitis. Given the differences in the demographic, clinical profiles, and the socio-economic realities between various countries, there is a need for development of guidelines for the management of AAV for less economically developed regions of the world. Methods: These guidelines were made following the GRADE methodology. After the systematic literature review, recommendations were formulated and opinion was sought from the 18-member expert panel consisting of 17 clinicians and one patient representative. Results: Twenty recommendations were formulated. We recommend ANCA testing by ELISA over IIF. For remission induction in active GPA or MPA, we recommend use of intravenous cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids. We conditionally recommend the use of reduced dose glucocorticoids over standard dose glucocorticoids for remission induction in active GPA or MPA. For remission maintenance in patients with GPA or MPA, we recommend the use of rituximab over azathioprine for at least 48 months from diagnosis. We conditionally recommend the use of plasma exchange in patients with severe renal vasculitis. For remission induction in EGPA, we recommend use of cyclophosphamide or rituximab in severe disease and mepolizumab or azathioprine or methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil in non-severe disease. Conclusions: These are the first ever Indian recommendations for the management of AAV. Despite our effort to formulate these recommendations based on high quality evidence, some recommendations were still based on low quality evidence but with high rate of agreement among expert panel members.

AB  - This letter critically evaluates the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on inflammatory bowel disease, particularly focusing on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as discussed in Liang et al's recent review. While the review provides significant insights, it relies heavily on cross-sectional and observational studies, which limits the ability to draw causal inferences. The heterogeneous study populations and inconsistent definitions of long-term PPI use further complicate the findings. This letter also highlights the need for rigorous control of confounding factors and considers the potential publication bias in the existing literature. The implications of these issues are discussed in the context of both CD and UC, and future research directions are proposed to address these shortcomings.

AB  - Aim & Background Delirium frequently occurs in the acute phase of sepsis and is associated with increased ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality rates. We utilized the Near-Infrared Spectroscopy monitor to measure and compare the regional cerebral oxygen saturation in mechanically ventilated patients of sepsis receiving either dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation and assessed the association between delirium and regional cerebral oxygen saturation.Methods A single center prospective randomized control trial conducted over a period of two years, 54 patients were included, equally divided between propofol and dexmedetomidine groups. Patients received a blinded study drug, propofol (10 mg/mL) or dexmedetomidine (5 mcg/mL) via infusion pump according to randomization. Infusion rates were adjusted every 10 min based on weight-based titration tables, aiming for target sedation (RASS -2 to 0). Management components included pain monitoring using the CPOT score and delirium assessment using CAM-ICU score.Results Dexmedetomidine group showed higher mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation as compared to propofol group (P = .036). No significant differences were found in mechanical ventilation or ICU stay durations, delirium-free days, or sedation cessation reasons. Delirium occurred in 36 patients, with lower mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation as compared to non-delirious patients.Conclusion The dexmedetomidine group had higher regional cerebral oxygen saturation compared to the propofol group. Delirious patients showed lower cerebral oxygen saturation than non-delirious patients, suggesting a link between sedation type, cerebral oxygenation, and delirium. CTRI registration: REF/2021/11/048655 NConclusion The dexmedetomidine group had higher regional cerebral oxygen saturation compared to the propofol group.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesImplementation of national haemovigilance programmes has significantly improved donor and recipient safety. Recently, India completed a decade of successful implementation of its national haemovigilance programmes. The national programme is still enrolling more blood centres. This study aimed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of Haemovigilance Programme of India (HvPI), thereby providing valuable insights for future initiatives.Materials and MethodsThe National Coordinating Centre (NCC) conducted a multi-centre, cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey among the reporting blood centres (January to April 2022). The survey consisted of three sections with a total of 27 questions focusing on the demographics of the participant blood centre as well as the impact on the recipient and donor haemovigilance. The survey was sent to 733 blood centres regularly reporting to the donor and recipient HvPI through Donor and Hemovigil Software.ResultsTotal 296 responses were received (response rate of 40.4%) with maximum participation of private non-teaching hospital-based blood centres (33.8%). After their involvement in recipient HvPI, 85.7% of the respondents reported changes in their blood centre's work procedures, with the maximum improvement seen in the documentation of transfusion reactions (92.7%). Out of the 278 respondents who participated in donor HvPI, 89.9% (250) found that their blood centre's policies or work process changed as a result of their involvement in the programme.ConclusionIn conclusion, our haemovigilance programme facilitates national collaboration for learning and sharing experiences, leading to improved policies and practices in reducing adverse reactions for both recipients and donors.

AB  - BackgroundHigh body-mass index (BMI) is an established risk factor for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, but most evidence comes from high-income contexts. Existing evidence from cross-sectional data in low- and middle-income settings is inconsistent, and many studies do not adequately address potential sources of bias.MethodsWe used data from Wave 1 of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) (analytic N = 56,753) to estimate the association between BMI categories and cognitive functioning among older adults aged 45 + years using survey-weighted linear regression models stratified by gender and controlling for potential confounders including demographic factors, socio-economic status (SES) characteristics, and health-related behaviors. To probe potential sources of bias, including residual confounding and reverse causation, we used weighting and trimming methods, sample restriction, and explored effect modification.ResultsIn fully adjusted models, relative to normal BMI underweight BMI was associated with lower cognitive scores (Men: -0.16 SD difference, 95% CI -0.18, -0.13; Women: -0.12 SD, -0.15, -0.10). Overweight and obesity were associated with higher cognitive scores in both men (overweight: 0.09; 0.07, 0.12, obese: 0.10; 0.05, 0.15) and women (overweight: 0.09; 0.07-0.12, obese: 0.12; 0.08-0.15). Estimates were similar after weighting and trimming but were attenuated after excluding those with low cognition (>= 1 SD below the mean relative to those with similar demographic characteristics). Positive associations between overweight and obese BMI and cognition were attenuated or null in those living in urban settings and those with higher levels of educational attainment.ConclusionsUnderweight BMI is a risk factor for poor cognitive outcomes in adults 45 years and older and may be indicative of poor nutritional status and life-course disadvantage in India. In tandem with existing literature, supplemental analyses and effect modification results indicate that unmeasured confounding and reverse causation may explain the observed positive associations between overweight and obese BMI and cognitive functioning from cross-sectional studies in low- and middle-income settings. Future data with longitudinal follow-up will be helpful to further disentangle biases.

AB  - Till few years ago cystic fibrosis (CF) was considered to be exclusively disease affecting Caucasian population. More recently CF has been reported from all over the world from different ethnic background. CF is an emerging illness in other parts of world (India with 1:2200 to 1:40,000 live birth). In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) diagnosis of CF is missed due to ignorance and nonavailability of diagnostic tests. Diagnosis can be made using clinical features and basic lab tests. As of now there is no cure, but supportive care improved survival. However, medicines used in higher income countries are very expensive and not accessible to children with CF in LMICs. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulators modulators have emerged as significant advances in management. These are very expensive and beyond the reach of patients in LMICs. CF Fraternity in developed countries should work towards training of personnel and possibly making medications available in LMICs.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved dynamic organelles that play an important role in cellular physiology. Growing evidence suggests that LD biogenesis occurs at discrete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) subdomains demarcated by the lipodystrophy protein, Seipin, lack of which impairs adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms of how these domains are selected is not completely known. These ER sites undergo ordered assembly of proteins and lipids to initiate LD biogenesis and facilitate establishment of ER-LD contact sites, a prerequisite for proper growth and maturation of droplets. LDs retain both physical and functional association with the ER throughout their lifecycle to facilitate bi-directional communication, such as exchange of proteins and lipids between the two organelles at these ER-LD contact sites. In recent years several molecular tethers have been identified that bridge ER and LDs together including few proteins that are found exclusively at these ER-LD contact interface. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of factors that ensure functionality of ER-LD contact site machinery for LD homeostasis.

AB  - Wound healing, an intricate biological process, comprises orderly phases of simple biological processed including hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and ECM remodeling. The regulation of the shift in these phases can be influenced by systemic or environmental conditions. Any untimely transitions between these phases can lead to chronic wounds and scarring, imposing a significant socio-economic burden on patients. Current treatment modalities are largely supportive in nature and primarily involve the prevention of infection and controlling inflammation. This often results in delayed healing and wound complications. Recent strides in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering offer innovative and patient-specific solutions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secretome have gained specific prominence in this regard. Additionally, technologies like tissue nano-transfection enable in situ gene editing, a need-specific approach without the requirement of complex laboratory procedures. Innovating approaches like 3D bioprinting and ECM bioscaffolds also hold the potential to address wounds at the molecular and cellular levels. These regenerative approaches target common healing obstacles, such as hyper-inflammation thereby promoting self-recovery through crucial signaling pathway stimulation. The rationale of this review is to examine the benefits and limitations of both current and emerging technologies in wound care and to offer insights into potential advancements in the field. The shift towards such patient-centric therapies reflects a paradigmatic change in wound care strategies.Graphical abstractPromising Modes of Treating Skin Wounds

KW  - GRADE FIBROMYXOID SARCOMA
AB  - Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) constitute a morphological continuum with certain overlapping histopathological features and MUC 4 immunopositivity. SEF is characterized by EWSR1 gene rearrangement, is relatively more aggressive and shows a limited response to chemotherapy. Lately, a subset of tumors with morphological features of SEF, but lacking MUC4 immunostaining and EWSR1 gene rearrangement have been observed. We report the first case of YAP1::KMT2A-positive sarcoma from the Indian subcontinent along with a review of similar tumors reported previously. A case of 31-year-old male presented with a 3 cm painful lump in the right suboccipital region. Histopathological examination of the excised specimen revealed a cellular tumor composed of atypical spindle and epithelioid cells, exhibiting moderate nuclear pleomorphism, arranged in cords, embedded in a dense collagenous/hyalinized stroma. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for cyclin D1 and negative for MUC4, desmin, myogenin, beta-catenin, STAT6, myoD1, SMA, and S100P. By fluorescence in-situ hybridization, EWSR1 gene rearrangement was negative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed YAP1exon5::KMT2Aexon4 fusion. Given a positive resection margin, he underwent a revision surgery involving wide local excision of the lesion including the outer table of the occipital bone followed by image-guided radiation therapy. Over 2 years of his follow-up, the patient is alive with no evidence of recurrence. Thus, YAP1::KMT2A positive sarcomas have distinct molecular and overlapping histopathological features with SEF, with relatively less aggressive disease course. Documentation of additional similar tumors with long-term follow-up is required.

AB  - Anti-PD immunotherapy is currently under investigation in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). Tumor cell surface PD-L1 expression is considered predictive of therapeutic response. Although papillary thyroid carcinoma has been widely studied for PD-L1 expression, there are limited data on ATC. In this retrospective multi-institutional study involving 9 centers across Asia, 179 ATCs were assessed for PD-L1 expression using the SP263 (Ventana) clone. A tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 1% was required to consider a case PD-L1-positive. PD-L1 expression was compared with the histological patterns, the type of specimen (small or large), tumor molecular profile (BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutation status), and patient outcome. PD-L1 expression in any co-existent differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) was evaluated separately and compared with ATC. Most ATCs (73.2%) were PD-L1-positive. The median TPS among positive cases was 36% (IQR 11% to 75%; range 1% to 99%). A high expression (TPS >= 50%) was noted in 30.7%. PD-L1-negative cases were more likely to be small specimens (P=0.01). A negative result on small samples, hence, may not preclude expression elsewhere. ATCs having epithelioid and pleomorphic histological patterns were more likely to be PD-L1-positive with higher TPS than sarcomatoid (P<0.01). DTCs were more frequently negative and had lower TPS than ATC (P<0.01). Such PD-L1 conversion from DTC-negative to ATC-positive was documented in 71% of cases with co-existent DTC. BRAF V600E, but not TERT promoter mutations, correlated significantly with PD-L1-positivity rate (P=0.039), reinforcing the potential of combining anti-PD and anti-BRAF V600E drugs. PD-L1 expression, however, did not impact the patient outcome.

AB  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a high-risk and low-volume life support with increasing clinical study. However, heterogenous outcome definitions impede data assimilation into evidence to guide practice. The Academic Research Consortium (ARC), an international collaborative forum committed to facilitating the creation of stakeholder-driven consensus nomenclature and outcomes for clinical trials of medical devices, supported the ECMO Core Elements Needed for Trials Regulation And quality of Life (ECMO-CENTRAL) ARC. The ECMO-CENTRAL ARC was assembled to develop definitions of paediatric ECMO adverse events for use in clinical trials and regulatory device evaluation. An initial candidate list of ECMO adverse events derived from the mechanical circulatory support ARC was supplemented with a review of ECMO-relevant adverse event definitions collated from literature published between Jan 1, 1988, and Feb 20, 2023. Distinct teams of international topic experts drafted separate adverse event definitions that were harmonised to existing literature when appropriate. Draft definitions were revised for paediatric ECMO relevance with input from patients, families, and an international expert panel of trialists, clinicians, statisticians, biomedical engineers, device developers, and regulatory agencies. ECMO-CENTRAL ARC was revised and disseminated across research societies and professional organisations. Up to three rounds of internet-based anonymous surveys were planned as a modified Delphi process. The expert panel defined 13 adverse event definitions: neurological, bleeding, device malfunction, acute kidney injury, haemolysis, infection, vascular access-associated injury, non-CNS thrombosis, hepatic dysfunction, right heart failure, left ventricular overload, lactic acidaemia, and hypoxaemia. Definitional structure varied. Among 165 expert panel members, 114 were eligible to vote and 111 voted. Consensus was achieved for all proposed definitions. Agreement ranged from 82% to 95%. ECMO-CENTRAL ARC paired rigorous development with methodical stakeholder involvement and dissemination to define paediatric ECMO adverse events. These definitions will facilitate new research and the assimilation of data across clinical trials and ECMO device evaluation in children.

AB  - Noninvasive sample sources of exosomes, such as exhaled breath and sputum, which are in close proximity to the tumor microenvironment and may contain biomarkers indicative of lung cancer, are far more permissive than invasive sample sources for biomarker screening. Standardized exosome extraction and characterization approaches for low-volume noninvasive samples are critically needed. We isolated and characterized exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and sputum exosomes from healthy nonsmokers (n = 30), tobacco smokers (n = 30), and lung cancer patients (n = 40) and correlated the findings with invasive sample sources. EBC samples were collected by using commercially available R-Tubes. To collect sputum samples the participants were directed to take deep breaths, hold their breath, and cough in a collection container. Dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the exosome morphology. Protein isolation, western blotting, exosome quantification via EXOCET, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed for molecular characterization. Exosomes were successfully isolated from EBC and sputum samples, and their yields were adequate and sufficiently pure for subsequent downstream processing and characterization. The exosomes were confirmed based on their size, shape, and surface marker expression. Remarkably, cancer exosomes were the largest in size not only in the plasma subgroups, but also in the EBC (p < 0.05) and sputum (p = 0.0036) subgroups, according to our findings. A significant difference in exosome concentrations were observed between the control sub-groups (p < 0.05). Our research confirmed that exosomes can be extracted from noninvasive sources, such as EBC and sputum, to investigate lung cancer diagnostic biomarkers for research, clinical, and early detection in smokers.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore and compare the utility of baseline F-18-PSMA-1007 and Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/computed tomography (CT) derived volumetric parameters in initial risk stratification and prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis.
   Methods: Forty treatment-naive, biopsy-proven intermediate-/high-risk PCa patients were prospectively recruited. Each patient underwent PET/CT with Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-PSMA-1007 (within 2 weeks). The maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) of primary tumor, prostate PSMA-tumor volume (PSMA-TVp), and prostate total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMAp) were measured.
   Results: PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp (with both radiotracers) mostly exhibited moderate-to-strong correlation with Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen level and clinical tumor stage (Spearman rho = 0.361-0.783, P-values <= 0.022). Primary tumor SUVmax values were similar across initial risk categories. PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp, however, were significantly higher in high-risk PCa compared to intermediate-risk PCa (P-values <= 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that F-PSMA-TVp, Ga-PSMA-TVp, F-TL-PSMAp, and Ga-TL-PSMAp (optimal cutoff values of 20.9, 23.4, 142.5, and 144.8, respectively) could effectively differentiate high-risk from intermediate-risk PCa [area under the ROC curve (AUCs) 0.859-0.898, P-values <0.001] with high sensitivity (similar to 68.8-75%) and excellent specificity (100%). PSMA-TVp and TL-PSMAp (with both radiotracers) could predict presence of regional and extraregional nodal metastasis (AUCs 0.703-0.801, P-values <= 0.03) with moderate sensitivity (similar to 47.8-70.6%) and excellent specificity (similar to 82.6-94.1%).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that baseline PSMA-PET primary tumor volumetric parameters provide a noninvasive, objective, and accurate index for initial risk stratification and can predict presence of regional and extraregional nodal metastasis in PCa patients. Larger studies are warranted to evaluate their incremental role over conventional parameters. Copyright (c) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND:The ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) demonstrated greater health status benefits with an initial invasive strategy, as compared with a conservative one, for patients with chronic coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia. Whether these benefits vary globally is important to understand to support global adoption of the results. METHODS:We analyzed participants' disease-specific health status using the validated 7-item Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ: >5-point differences are clinically important) at baseline and over 1-year follow-up across 37 countries in 6 international regions. The average effect of initial invasive versus conservative strategies on 1-year SAQ scores was estimated using Bayesian proportional odds regression and compared across regions. RESULTS:Considerable regional variation in baseline health status was observed among 4617 participants (mean age=64.4 +/- 9.5 years, 24% women), with the mean SAQ summary scores of 67.4 +/- 19.5 in Eastern Europe participants (17% of the total), 71.4 +/- 15.4 in Asia-Pacific (18%), 74.9 +/- 16.7 in Central and South America (10%), 75.5 +/- 19.5 in Western Europe (26%), and 78.6 +/- 19.2 in North America (28%). One-year improvements in SAQ scores were greater in regions with lower baseline scores with initial invasive management (17.7 +/- 20.9 in Eastern Europe and 11.4 +/- 19.3 in North America), but similar in the conservative arm. Adjusting for baseline SAQ scores, similar health status benefits of an initial invasive strategy on 1-year SAQ scores were observed (ranging from 2.38 points [95% CI, 0.04-4.50] in North America to 4.66 points [95% CI, 2.46-6.94] in Eastern Europe), with an 88.3% probability that the difference in benefit across regions was <5 points. CONCLUSIONS:In patients with chronic coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, initial invasive management was associated with a consistent health status benefit across regions, with modest regional variability, supporting the international generalizability of health status benefits from invasive management of chronic coronary disease.

AB  - Eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) is an aggressive skin cancer characterized by a heightened risk of recurrence and metastasis. While surgical excision is the primary treatment, unraveling the molecular intricacies of SGC is imperative for advancing targeted therapeutic interventions and enhancing patient outcomes. This comprehensive review delves into the molecular landscape of eyelid SGC, emphasizing key genetic alterations, signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and potential therapeutic targets. Significant findings include aberrations in critical signaling pathways (beta-catenin, lymphoid enhancer binding factor, hedgehog, epidermal growth factor receptor, P53, and P21WAF1) associated with SGC progression and poor prognosis. Notably, eyelid SGC manifests a distinctive mutational profile, lacking ultraviolet signature mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53), indicating alternative mutagenic mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing identifies actionable mutations in genes such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), facilitating the emergence of personalized medicine approaches. Molecular chaperones, specifically X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and BAG3, emerge as pivotal players in promoting tumor survival and proliferation. The review underscores the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, where regulators like E-cadherin, vimentin, and ZEB2 contribute to SGC aggressiveness. Epigenetic modifications, encompassing DNA methylation and microRNA dysregulation, further elucidate the molecular landscape. This review consolidates a comprehensive understanding of the molecular drivers of eyelid SGC, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets and providing a foundation for future investigations in diagnostic, prognostic, and personalized treatment strategies for this formidable malignancy.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to characterize the profile of myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies (MSAs/MAAs) in an Indian cohort of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients and correlate them with clinical features and outcomes.MethodsForty-three children diagnosed with JDM were enrolled for this observational study. Clinical details (presentation, course, and outcome) were noted in a predesigned proforma. Serum samples were tested for 16 MSAs/MAAs by line immunoassay. MSAs/MAAs were correlated with clinical features and outcome (defined as a complete clinical response [>= 6 months' disease inactivity on medication] or complete remission [>= 6 months' inactivity off all drugs]).ResultsThirty-five subjects (81.4%) had at least 1 MSA/MAA detected. The most common antibodies were anti-NXP2 (n = 13, 30.2%), anti-TIF1 gamma (n = 10, 23.2%), and anti-MDA-5 (n = 8, 18.6%). No patient had anti-Ku, anti-Pm Scl-100, anti-PL-12, anti-EJ, anti-OJ, or anti-Ro52. Thirty-two patients (74.4%) attained a complete clinical response over a median follow-up duration of 14 months, among which 6 (13.9%) achieved complete remission over a median follow-up duration of 30 months. Anti-TIF1 gamma was associated with younger age at onset (<= 3 years) (odds ratio [OR], 6.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-34.12; p = 0.034) and disease flares after attaining complete response (OR, 10.18; 95% CI, 1.64-70.93; p = 0.013). Patients with anti-NXP2 had higher odds of severe muscular weakness (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 0.95-14.59; p = 0.058) and truncal weakness (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 0.97-15.64; p = 0.056). One child with anti-MDA-5 positivity had interstitial lung disease. We found no association between the MSA/MAA profile and the achievement of complete clinical response or remission.ConclusionsMSAs/MAAs were identified in 81% of children with JDM in our study, which is higher than most other studies. The most frequently observed antibodies displayed a pattern consistent with other studies. Anti-TIF1 gamma was associated with a younger age at onset and disease flares even after attaining a complete clinical response. Anti-NXP2 had higher odds of severe muscular weakness. These observations suggest consistency in certain phenotypic associations observed across geographic boundaries.

AB  - Introduction: Benign fibro-osseous lesions have long been an area of diagnostic difficulty due to overlapping of histological and radiological features. Differentiating between these lesions is crucial because of their unique pathogenesis and biological behavior. Ossifying fibroma (OF) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) are the most prevalent lesions. However, not all FD or OF exhibit the typical radiological and histopathological features. In such situations, molecular-level investigations could be essential for precise identification and differentiation. Aim: To evaluate the screening of GNAS and CDC73 mutations in blood and formalin fixed tumor tissues (FFTT) of FD and OF cases. Material and methods: Six blood samples (three cases of FD and JOF each) and thirteen FFTT (six cases of FD and seven cases of JOF) were included in the study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using salting out method followed by whole exome sequencing. Multiple efforts were made to extract DNA from tumor tissues using various protocols, but no measurable yield was obtained. Results: DNA derived from blood samples gave successful DNA library preparation and subsequent exome sequencing data generation. We report a pathogenic GNAS mutation (exon8:c.G602A:p.R201H) associated with McCune-Albright syndrome and a novel benign mutation identified in a case of FD (GNAS(NM_000516.7): c.257+687_257+688del) whereas none of the subjects of JOF displayed GNAS and/or CDC73 mutation. Conclusion: Study observed mutations in GNAS gene in blood samples from FD cases. However, a limitation is that only DNA extracted from blood underwent successful exome sequencing. Potential reason for low-quality DNA extraction from tissue may be attributed to prior fixation procedures conducted on bone specimens.

AB  - Objective was to assess the precision and reproducibility of spatial penalty-based intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) methods in comparison to the conventional bi-exponential (BE) model-based IVIM methods. IVIM-MRI (11 b-values; 0-800 s/mm(2)) of forty patients (N = 40; Age = 17.7 +/- 5.9 years; Male:Female = 30:10) with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla scanner at 3 time-points: (i) baseline, (ii) after 1-cycle and (iii) after 3-cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Diffusion coefficient (D), Perfusion coefficient (D*) and Perfusion fraction (f) were estimated at three time-points in whole tumor and healthy muscle tissue using five methodologies (1) BE with three-parameter-fitting (BE), (2) Segmented-BE with two-parameter-fitting (BESeg-2), (3) Segmented-BE with one-parameter-fitting (BESeg-1), (4) BE with adaptive Total-Variation-penalty (BE + TV) and (5) BE with adaptive Huber-penalty (BE + HPF). Within-subject coefficient-of-variation (wCV) and between-subject coefficient-of-variation (bCV) of IVIM parameters were measured in healthy and tumor tissue. For precision and reproducibility, intra-scan comparison of wCV and bCV among five IVIM methods were performed using Friedman test followed by Wilcoxon-signed-ranks (WSR) post-hoc test. Experimental results demonstrated that BE + TV and BE + HPF showed significantly (p < 10(-3)) lower wCV and bCV for D (wCV: 24-32%; bCV: 22-31%) than BE method (wCV: 38-49%; bCV: 36-46%) across three time-points in healthy muscle and tumor. BE + TV and BE + HPF also demonstrated significantly (p < 10(-3)) lower wCV and bCV for estimating D* (wCV: 89-108%; bCV: 83-102%) and f (wCV: 55-60%; bCV: 56-60%) than BE, BESeg-2 and BESeg-1 methods (D*-wCV: 102-122%; D*-bCV: 98-114% and f-wCV: 96-130%; f-bCV: 94-125%) in both tumor and healthy tissue across three time-points. Spatial penalty based IVIM analysis methods BE + TV and BE + HPF demonstrated lower variability and improved precision and reproducibility in the current clinical settings.

AB  - Auditory and visual cues have been efficacious in laboratory-based freezing of gait (FoG) mitigation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, real-life applications of these cues are restricted due to inconvenience to the users. Closed-loop vibrotactile cues based on temporal gait events have overcome the shortcomings of auditory and visual cueing. However, kinematic gait parameter-driven vibrotactile cueing has not been explored yet. Kinematic gait parameter-driven cueing is more effective than temporal cueing, according to FoG pathophysiology studies. Therefore, we developed and pilot-tested a novel cueing scheme in which the foot-to-ground angle at heel strike (FGA_HS) is estimated using indigenous instrumented shoes to drive vibrotactile cueing. Ten PD freezers underwent a 6-meter timed walk test in the off-medication state with and without the cue and after medication without the cue. The proposed system potentially mitigated FoG, quantified by a reduction in the ratio of time spent freezing to the total walking time and the number of FoGs. The FoG mitigation potential of the cue was further supported by increased anteroposterior center of pressure progression and FGA_HS. With a future comprehensive validation in a larger number of participants, the novel cue could likely be used in practice and commercialized.

AB  - Introduction:Many countries from South-East Asia reported an epidemic of sino-orbital mucormycosis (SOM), otherwise a rare disease, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SOM, a potentially fatal disease, is typically treated with orbital exenteration and systemic antifungals after metabolic stabilization. There is no clear evidence of survival benefit of exenteration in the literature, and thus, there have been attempts at globe conserving treatments like orbital infusion after limited debridement and intraorbital injections with Amphotericin B (IOAB).Methods:We conducted a prospective comparative interventional study at a tertiary eye care hospital to evaluate treatment outcomes with the use of adjunctive IOAB in cases of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease.Results:Thirty-six patients of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease were recruited in the study. In the intervention group, 23/26 (885%) eyes had stable orbital disease at the end of treatment (4-6 weeks). No deterioration in visual acuity was noted as a result of treatment. In 8/26 (30.77%) patients, inflammation was noted as a side effect of IOAB requiring temporary discontinuation of injections. The mean follow-up for cases was 14.2 months (range 12-15 months). 1/23 (4.35%) patients had relapse of orbital disease at 3 months. Twenty-one patients are alive on last follow-up. Of the patients who refused treatment (controls), 2/9 (22.22%) patients relapsed. One of these patients with relapse underwent exenteration, while the other was managed with IOAB. At a follow-up of 14 months (range 12-15 months), eight patients are alive. On evaluating the ocular parameters in salvaged eyes, improvement in extraocular movements was noted in 75-80% cases. The degree of proptosis and resistance to retropulsion did not change significantly.Conclusion:In the current study, an improvement in the globe salvage rates was noted in cases of SOM with mild to moderate orbital disease treated with adjunctive IOAB as compared to controls at a mean follow-up of 14 months, although it did not achieve statistical significance. The study supports the inclusion of IOAB in routine management of mild to moderate orbital disease.

AB  - Purpose:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to overall interrupted medical care, resulting in disease progression and morbidity. The study aimed to evaluate clinicopathological presentations and severity of eyelid malignancy during the COVID era, comparing the results with patients presented during pre-COVID era and evaluating the reasons for delayed presentation in patients with advanced eyelid malignancy in the COVID-era.Methods:This was a comparative, ambispective observational study. Data regarding demographic, clinical, histopathology, and treatment modalities of confirmed cases of eyelid malignancy admitted during the period from March 2020 to September 2022 (defined as COVID era group) were collected and compared with retrospectively collected data from March 2017 to March 2020 (defined as pre-COVID era group). COVID era patients were further categorized as localized and advanced disease. Patients with advanced eyelid malignancy during COVID era were further subjected to a questionnaire to evaluate the reasons for delayed presentation.Results:In total, 115 patients of eyelid malignancy were studied [COVID era group 40 (35%) and pre-COVID era group 75 (65%)]. A statistically significant increase in the duration of disease (P = 0.0001) and advanced tumor T-stage (P = 0.03) was noticed in the COVID era group. Demographic, histopathology, and ocular morbidity details were similar in both groups. The common reasons that led to delay in presentation and treatment in advanced T-stage patients during the COVID era were fear of acquiring COVID, lockdown, and lack of medical facilities.Conclusion:During the COVID-19 pandemic, both hospital- and patient-related factors contributed to delay in presentation, leading to advanced-stage disease indicating need of triaging of eyelid malignancy in the event of such pandemics in future.

AB  - Purpose of review Despite advances in our radiological, histological and microbiological armamentarium, distinguishing between Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB), especially in a TB endemic country, continues to be a challenging exercise in a significant number of patients. This review aims to summarize current available evidence on novel diagnostic techniques which have a potential to fill the gap in our knowledge of differentiating between ITB and CD. Recent findings Both ITB and CD are associated with altered host immune responses, and detection of these altered innate and adaptive immune cells has potential to distinguish ITB from CD. ITB and CD have different epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic signatures, and recent research has focused on detecting these differences. In addition, the gut microbiome, which is involved in mucosal immunity and inflammatory responses, is considerably altered in both ITB and CD, and is another potential frontier, which can be tapped to discriminate between the two diseases. With technological advancements, we have newer radiological modalities including perfusion CT and dual-layer spectral detector CT enterography and evidence is emerging of their role in differentiating ITB from CD. Finally, time will tell whether the advent of artificial intelligence, with rapidly accumulating data in this field, will be the gamechanger in solving this puzzle of diagnostic dilemma between ITB and Crohn's disease. Summary Recent advances need to be clinically validated before they can be used as novel diagnostic measures to differentiate Intestinal TB from CD.

AB  - Brachytherapy (BT) is an extensively used treatment modality for cancer in many sites in the body. In this treatment method, small radioactive sources are localized proximal to cancerous tumors. The commercially available applicators, templates, etc., used for tumor localization and targeting in BT have standard sizes and dimensions. Besides this, researchers are now focusing on achieving more accuracy in BT. This goal can be accomplished through 3D printing technology, also known as "additive manufacturing" (AM) or rapid prototyping, which has rapidly evolved in numerous applications. The 3D printing technology has enormous potential to perform personalized BT products and has enormous scope to improve clinical outcomes while lowering the risk of radiation-induced toxicity by growing recognition of precision medicine. In this review, the authors summarize the application of 3D printing in BT, and the challenges in developing a practical system are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Region-specific data on individual factors associated with uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening or early testing in diverse Indian populations are limited. Aim: To assess the prevalence and individual determinants of uptake of breast and/or cervical cancer screening or testing among women aged 30-69 years in regionally representative populations of two large Indian cities: New Delhi and Chennai. Methods: We conducted an analysis of the cross-sectional data (2016-2017) nested within the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia cohort, established in 2010-2011 with 12,271 participants (5365 in New Delhi; 6906 in Chennai). Among 3310 women participants, we evaluated the associations of demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, medical, psychosocial, and reproductive factors with breast and/or cervical cancer screening or testing using multivariable logistic regression models with results expressed as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: At any point prior to 2016-2017, 193 women self-reported having undergone evaluations for breast and/or cervical cancer. The reasons for evaluation were 'general examination' or 'physician's advice' (i.e., screening) or 'being symptomatic' (i.e., early testing). The overall prevalence was 5.8% for screening or testing and 2.5% for screening alone. Formal education (OR:1.88; 95% CI:1.12-3.15), high monthly household income (OR:2.27; 95% CI:1.59-3.25) and less 'fear-of-judgement' (OR:1.65; 95% CI:1.05-2.58) were positively associated with screening or testing uptake. When screening uptake was analysed separately, the results were generally similar. Conclusion: Our findings may have important implications for interventions at community-level (e.g., reducing 'fear-of-judgement', increasing awareness to screening programs and early symptoms) and health-system level (e. g., opportunistic screening).

AB  - Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) occurs in bone marrow failure due to a variety of causes. Although common in hematological disorders like myelofibrosis and hemoglobinopathies, EMH occurring as a result of bone marrow metastasis from solid tumors is very rare. We report a case of EMH subsequent to bone marrow metastasis from parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma in a 17-year-old girl. The patient presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed metastasis from rhabdomyosarcoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed and revealed an enhancing mass in the left nasal cavity, with adjacent bone erosion suggestive of parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, multiple homogenously enhancing masses were seen in the paravertebral location, adjoining multiple bilateral ribs, along the anterior surface of the sternum and in the presacral space, suggestive of EMH. Chemotherapy was subsequently started, but the patient developed febrile neutropenia and expired as a result of septic shock.

AB  - This was a prospective, interventional, comparative study conducted on patients with congenital simple severe ptosis. A novel method of silicone rod fixation to the tarsus (tarsal tunnel technique, group 1) was done compared with a conventional technique of silicone rod fixation (suture fixation technique, group 2) in frontalis suspension surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized into two groups of 15 patients each. Postoperatively, MRD1, vertical palpebral aperture, and eyelid fold height were comparable in both groups till the last follow-up with stability in eyelid position. Patient satisfaction scores showed similar results with good-fair satisfaction grading in 13 patients in group 1 and 11 patients in group 2 at 6 months follow-up. No significant complications occurred in either group. Tarsal tunnel fixation of silicone rods is a novel method in sling surgery with optimal cosmetic and function outcomes. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the results of the technique.

AB  - This study aimed to comprehensively explore the intricacies of corneal neurotization (CN) and the nuanced factors that set it apart from routine clinical practice, exerting a substantial influence on its success. A symbiotic relationship is evident between corneal innervation and ocular surface health. The loss of corneal innervation results in a potentially challenging corneal condition known as neurotrophic keratopathy (NK). The majority of treatments are primarily focused on preventing epithelial breakdown rather than addressing the underlying pathogenesis. Consequently, to address the impaired corneal sensation (underlying etiology), a novel surgical approach has emerged, namely CN, which involves transferring healthy sensory nerve axons to the affected cornea. This review offers valuable insights into the existing body of supporting evidence for CN, meticulously examining clinical studies, case reports, and experimental findings. The aim is to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness and potential outcomes associated with this innovative surgical technique. The exploration of innovative therapeutic avenues holds promise for revolutionizing the management of NK, offering a potentially permanent solution to a condition once deemed incurable and severely debilitating.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) with cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) for the management of total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) in eyes with unilateral ocular burns. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: 100 patients (100 eyes) with unilateral total LSCD following ocular burns undergoing autologous Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation (LSCT) were enrolled and randomized into SLET and CLET groups. Restoration of an epithelized ocular surface was the primary outcome measure. Occurrences of progressive conjunctivalization and persistent epithelial defects postoperatively were considered surgical failures. Results: Mean age was 20.2 f 13.1 years (SLET) and 22.6 f 14.3 years (CLET) (p = 0.363). Alkali burn was the most common causative factor in both groups and had comparable mean logMAR BCVA at presentation [SLET: 2.33 f 0.5, CLET: 2.23 f 1.48 (p = 0.652)]. Median time interval between injury and surgical intervention was 18 months (SLET) and 12 months (CLET) (p = 0.06). 88 % eyes in SLET group maintained a stable ocular surface at 1 year period versus CLET group (86 %) (p = 0.999). Mean logMAR BCVA significantly improved in both groups with SLET having significantly better BCVA versus CLET at 6 months (p = 0.0390), 1 year (p = 0.0001), 2 year (p = 0.0001) and 3 years (p = 0.0001) follow up. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was statistically insignificant amongst the 2 groups (p = 0.590). Conclusions: Compared to CLET, SLET is equally efficacious in restoring and maintaining a stable ocular surface in eyes with total LSCD due to ocular burns, with the added advantage of providing superior visual outcomes.

AB  - Globally, 15% of the population suffers from disability. However, the percentage of people visiting hospitals who may be suffering from some form of disability may be higher. It may cause difficulty in accessing the health-care facilities. Universal design features help assimilate persons with disabilities with the mainstream. Patients on trolleys in hospitals jostling with vehicular traffic are a common sight. The lack of functional, dedicated, and encumbrance-free sidewalks for the movement of trolleys is a hindrance. We wish to highlight this aspect, suggest some remedial measures, and initiate a conversation among the health-care planners through this article.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:Limited evidence exists on the optimal strategy to correct iron deficiency anemia after variceal bleeding (VB) in cirrhosis. This trial compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (IV-FCM) with those of oral iron therapy in this cohort. METHODS:In this open-label, single-center, randomized controlled trial, eligible patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dL and iron deficiency (ferritin <100 ng/mL) after VB received either IV-FCM (1,500-2,000 mg) divided into 2 doses (n = 48) or oral carbonyl iron (100 mg elemental iron/day) (n = 44) for 3 months. The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anemia (last hemoglobin >12 g/dL), normalization of iron stores (ferritin >100 ng/mL), liver-related adverse events, adverse drug reactions, and changes in quality of life (CLDQOL questionnaire). RESULTS:Baseline characteristics, including median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score 7 (interquartile range [IQR] 6-9), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score 12 (IQR 10-17), blood hemoglobin (8.25 +/- 1.06 g/dL), and ferritin (30.00 ng/mL [15.00-66.50]), were comparable in both arms. The median increase in hemoglobin at 3 months in the IV and oral arms was 3.65 g/dL (IQR 2.55-5.25) and 1.10 g/dL (IQR 0.05-2.90 g/dL) (P < 0.001), respectively. Iron stores normalized in 84.6% and 21% of the IV and oral arms, respectively (P < 0.001). Anemia improved in 50% and 21.9% in the IV and oral arms, respectively (P < 0.009). Patients in the IV arm showed a significant improvement in all domains of CLDQOL. Liver-related adverse events were comparable in both arms. Transient mild/moderate hypophosphatemia developed in 43% of patients receiving IV-FCM. DISCUSSION:Intravenous iron replacement is efficacious and safe to treat iron deficiency anemia after VB in patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - Thoracoabdominal duplication cysts are a congenital malformation of the posterior primitive foregut with synchronous thoracic and abdominal duplication cysts being found in up to 15% of cases. The presentation of duplication cysts depends on their location, size, and other factors, like the presence of ectopic functioning gastric mucosa, which is reported in 20%-30% of duplication cysts. Tc-99m-pertechnetate scintigraphy along with SPECT/CT helps in the preoperative localization of ectopic functioning gastric mucosa in these duplication cysts. We report the scintigraphic and SPECT/CT findings of one such case, which helped in the final diagnosis and management of the patient.

AB  - Background The tobacco epidemic signifies a major public health threat. Nicotine (NIC), a major active constituent in tobacco, impedes male fertility and semen quality. This work is implemented to explore the potential of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and the newly fabricated SeNPs @vitamin C (SeNPs@VITC) nanocomposite in mitigating testicular toxicity induced by NIC.Materials and methods The six groups of 48 adult Wistar rats were designed as follows: the control group injected intraperitoneally with normal saline, the SeNPs group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs, the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group treated orally with 2 mg/kg of SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, the NIC group injected intraperitoneally with 1.25 mL/kg of NIC, the NIC+ SeNPs group received SeNPs plus NIC, and the NIC+ SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite group received SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite plus NIC. Treatments were administered over a 28-day period.Results NIC treatment significantly caused poor sperm quality, decreased serum testosterone, increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, reduced hemoglobin levels, leukocytosis, disrupted testicular oxidant/antioxidant balance, and disorganized testicular structure. The construction of the novel SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite, compared to NIC plus SeNPs alone, demonstrated a more potent ameliorative effect on NIC-induced reproductive toxicity in adult rats. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite significantly increased sperm count, reduced the percentage of sperm head abnormalities, lowered both serum FSH and LH concentrations, and improved the hemoglobin response.Conclusions Both SeNPs and SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite alleviated the testicular toxicity induced by NIC, but the SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite exhibited superior efficacy. The SeNPs@VITC nanocomposite could be employed to advance enhanced therapeutic strategies for addressing male infertility.

AB  - Traditionally, psammoma bodies (PB) have been considered as tale-tell evidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and are frequently encountered in classic and other subtypes of PTCs. However, the presence of PBs in the thyroid gland does not always indicate malignancy. The leading hypothesis on their origin suggests that PB are remnants of papillary structures that have undergone thrombosis, necrosis, and subsequent calcification. From January 2010 to May 2024, 26 patients with psammoma bodies associated with benign thyroid lesions, mainly thyroid follicular nodular disease (TFND), Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease, and follicular adenomas, were found. The case cohort included 16 females and 10 males with a median age of 49.3 years. The series included 12 TFND, two HT, and 12 follicular adenomas (11 out of 12 were oncocytic adenomas). Twenty-four out of 26 underwent total thyroidectomy. In 24 out of 26 cases, the entire lobes and parenchyma were included and serial cuts at multiple levels were performed in cases with PB but without any evidence of malignancy. Even though the detection of PB is associated with a malignant thyroid lesion, especially PTC and its subtypes, our multi-institutional series showed that in a minority PB can be found in a variety of benign thyroid lesions. Evaluation of the entire thyroid parenchyma at multiple levels is mandatory to exclude sub-centimeter papillary thyroid carcinoma.

AB  - BackgroundEruption of primary teeth is associated with local and systemic manifestations. Understanding the global prevalence is necessary to formulate the standard guidelines for management.AimTo evaluate the global prevalence of problems associated with teething in infants and children aged 0-36 months.DesignPubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched on May 31, 2023, and it was updated on January 31, 2024. Gray literature and reference search were performed. Cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies done in hospital or community settings, reporting the prevalence of signs and symptoms during the eruption of primary teeth in infants aged 0-36 months, were included. Two reviewers extracted data using a pre-piloted sheet. Data were analyzed and pooled by using random-effects meta-analyses.ResultsTwenty-five studies were included. The global prevalence of teething problems was 80.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.8-89.9). The most common local symptom was increased biting (65.9%, 95% CI 37.5-89.3), and irritability (60.7%, 95% CI 50.6-70.3) was the most common general symptom.ConclusionThe pooled prevalence of teething problems was estimated to be 80%. There was a variability in the prevalence of teething problems based on geographic location.

AB  - Background: In two phase 3 studies, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) showed non-inferior efficacy versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), with more favourable renal and bone safety in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Aims: Here, we report the studies' final 8-year results. Methods: CHB patients (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-negative and HBeAg-positive) were randomised (2:1) to double-blind TAF 25 mg/day or TDF 300 mg/day for up to 3 years, followed by open-label (OL) TAF through year 8. Virological, biochemical, serological and fibrosis responses, and safety, including bone and renal parameters, were evaluated. Resistance to TAF was assessed annually by deep sequencing of polymerase/reverse transcriptase and by phenotyping. Results: Among 1298 patients randomised to double-blind TAF (n = 866) or double-blind TDF (n = 432), 775 in the TAF group and 382 in the TDF group received OL TAF, including 180 and 202 who switched from TDF to TAF at year 2 (TDF2y -> TAF6y) or year 3 (TDF3y -> TAF5y), respectively. At year 8, among patients in the TAF8y, TDF2y -> TAF6y and TDF3y -> TAF5y groups, 69%, 66% and 73% (missing-equals-failure analysis) and 95%, 94% and 97% (missing-equals-excluded) of patients, respectively, achieved HBV DNA <29 IU/mL. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (Cockcroft-Gault method; eGFR(CG)) and hip/spine bone mineral density (BMD) remained stable in patients receiving double-blind/OL TAF, with only small declines at year 8. Decreases in eGFRCG and hip/spine BMD observed during double-blind TDF improved after switching to OL TAF. No patients developed resistance to TAF. Conclusion: Long-term TAF treatment exhibited favourable safety and tolerability with high rates of viral suppression and no development of resistance.

TI  - High-resolution AI image dataset for diagnosing oral submucous fibrosis and squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA  - English
AB  - Oral cancer is a global health challenge with a difficult histopathological diagnosis. The accurate histopathological interpretation of oral cancer tissue samples remains difficult. However, early diagnosis is very challenging due to a lack of experienced pathologists and inter- observer variability in diagnosis. The application of artificial intelligence (deep learning algorithms) for oral cancer histology images is very promising for rapid diagnosis. However, it requires a quality annotated dataset to build AI models. We present ORCHID (ORal Cancer Histology Image Database), a specialized database generated to advance research in AI-based histology image analytics of oral cancer and precancer. The ORCHID database is an extensive multicenter collection of high-resolution images captured at 1000X effective magnification (100X objective lens), encapsulating various oral cancer and precancer categories, such as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Additionally, it also contains grade-level sub-classifications for OSCC, such as well- differentiated (WD), moderately-differentiated (MD), and poorly-differentiated (PD). The database seeks to aid in developing innovative artificial intelligence-based rapid diagnostics for OSMF and OSCC, along with subtypes.

AB  - Introduction: The global rise in ulcerative colitis (UC) incidence highlights the urgent need for enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic loci associated with UC, providing insights into the disease's molecular mechanisms, including immune modulation, mucosal defense, and epithelial barrier function. Despite these findings, many GWAS signals are located in non-coding regions and are linked to low risk, suggesting that protein-coding genes alone do not fully explain UC's pathophysiology. Emerging research emphasizes the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets due to their crucial role in UC. This review explores the current understanding of miRNAs in UC, including their mechanisms of action and their potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The present review provides the latest update on their potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Areas covered: This review synthesizes an extensive literature search on miRNAs in UC, focusing on their roles in the mucosal barrier, innate and adaptive immunity, and their potential applications as biomarkers and therapeutic modalities. Expert opinion: While miRNAs present promising opportunities as biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents in UC, challenges in validation, specificity, delivery, and clinical application need to be addressed through rigorous, large-scale studies.

AB  - Background: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) has been described in the literature mostly as early-onset leukodystrophy with cerebellar ataxia being the main clinical phenotype. However, other associated movement disorders have also been reported discretely. Cases: Here, we present seven cases of MLC. Cerebellar ataxia was common in them, while dystonia was present in six, parkinsonism in one and stereotypy in two. Six of them, belonging to the Agarwal community, had the common c.135dup variant. Conclusion: Our observation highlights the presence of movement disorders in MLC beyond cerebellar ataxia and phenotypic variability of the c.135dup variant, prevalent in the Agarwal community.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has long been a challenging disease owing to its high aggressive behaviour, poor prognosis and its limited treatment options. The growing demand of new therapeutics against TNBC enables us to examine the therapeutic efficiency of an emerging class of anticancer compounds, azapodophyllotoxin derivative (HTDQ), a nitrogen analogue of podophyllotoxin, using different biochemical, spectroscopic and computational approaches. The anticancer activities of HTDQ are studied by performing MTT assay in a dose depended manner on Triple negative breast cancer cells using MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with IC50 50 value 937 nM and 1.13 mu M respectively while demonstrating minimal effect on normal epithelial cells. The efficacy of HTDQ was further tested in 3D tumour spheroids formed by the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB468 and also the murine MMTV positive TNBC cell line 4 T1. The shrinkage that observed in the tumor spheroid clearly indicates that HTDQ remarkably decreases the growth of tumor spheroid thereby affirming its cytotoxicity. The 2D cell viability assay shows significant morphological alteration that possibly caused by the cytoskeleton disturbances. Hence the binding interaction of HTDQ with cytoskeleton protein tubulin, its effect on tubulin polymerisation as well as depolymerisation of preformed microtubules along with the conformational alternation in the protein itself have been investigated in detail. Moreover, the apoptotic effects of HTDQ have been examined using a range of apoptotic markers. HTDQ-treated cancer cells showed increased expression of cleaved PARP-1 and pro-caspase-3, suggesting activation of the apoptosis process. HTDQ also upregulated proapoptotic Bax expression while inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl2 expression, supporting its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Hence the consolidated biochemical and spectroscopic research described herein may provide enormous information to use azapodophyllotoxin as promising anticancer therapeutics for TNBC cells.

AB  - Pure intertubular seminoma (PITS) of the testis is described as the presence of seminoma cells within the interstitium of testis without any evidence of diffuse growth pattern or mass lesion of classical seminoma. These tumors are clinically and grossly inconspicuous and are diagnosed incidentally or during investigations for testicular pain, infertility or other symptoms. Rarely metastasis is the first presentation. Microscopic identification can be difficult and poses a diagnostic challenge in the absence of a mass lesion. Seminomas with exclusive intertubular growth patterns were gathered in an international cohort. Diagnoses were confirmed by fellowship- trained or specialized urologic pathologists. Cases with the presence of a classical diffuse or nested pattern of seminoma or any other germ cell tumor component were excluded. The patient's age, tumor characteristics and additional clinicopathologic features were recorded and analyzed. 15 patients of pure intertubular seminoma (PITS) were collated. . The mean age of presentation was 29 years. Patients presented with variable symptoms, including undescended testis (26%, n = 4/15), testicular heaviness/pain (20%, n = 3/15) infertility (20%, n = 3/ 15) and metastasis (6%, n = 1/15); presentation was unknown in 4 patients. Of note, none of the patients presented because of testicular mass. Serum markers were within normal limits in most patients (93%, n = 14/ 15) with available data. No tumors were identified macroscopically; however, an ill-defined, grey-white, firm area was noted in one orchiectomy specimen. Microscopically, tumor cells were seen in intertubular spaces as dispersed individual cells or small clusters. Tumor cells were round to polygonal with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates were seen admixed with tumor cells in 40% (n = 6/15) of the tumors. GCNIS was present in association with most PITS (73%, n = 11/15). Tubular atrophy with thickening of the basement membrane and Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed in one tumor. Thirty-three percent (n = 5/15) of the tumors showed pagetoid involvement of rete testis, including the tumor with metastasis. All tumors showed the classical immunohistochemical profile of seminoma, with PLAP, c-KIT, OCT3/4, D2-40 and SALL4 positivity. PITS can be clinically & pathologically inconspicuous, difficult to stage and liable to be misdiagnosed especially if presented with metastasis. Despite the inconspicuousness, PITS may represent an aggressive growth pattern of seminoma with the propensity for rete testis invasion.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of the neurons, excessive accumulation of misfolded A beta and Tau proteins, and degeneration of neural synapses, primarily occurring in the neocortex and the hippocampus regions of the brain. AD Progression is marked by cognitive deterioration, memory decline, disorientation, and loss of problem-solving skills, as well as language. Due to limited comprehension of the factors contributing to AD and its severity due to neuronal loss, even today, the medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not precisely efficient and curative. Stem cells possess great potential in aiding AD due to their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation properties. Stem cell therapy can aid by replacing the lost neurons, enhancing neurogenesis, and providing an enriched environment to the pre-existing neural cells. Stem cell therapy has provided us with promising results in regard to the animal AD models, and even pre-clinical studies have shown rather positive results. Cell replacement therapies are potential curative means to treat AD, and there are a number of undergoing human clinical trials to make Stem Cell therapy accessible for AD patients. In this review, we aim to discuss the AD pathophysiology and varied stem cell types and their application.

AB  - Purpose To compare outcomes of gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) over a 12-month period with trabeculectomy in patients with advanced pigmentary glaucoma (PG).Methods This was a pilot randomised controlled trial of patients with advanced PG (mean deviation worse than -12 dB), undergoing either GATT or a fornix-based trabeculectomy. Absolute success (criterion A) was defined as a postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 18 mm Hg, with a drop of at least 30% from the treated preoperative value without need of any IOP-lowering medication. Success (criterion B) was also defined as per the target IOP, with an upper limit of 15 mm Hg for eyes with mean deviation (MD) between -12 and -24 dB, and 12 mm Hg or lower for MD values worse than -24 dB. Qualified success was a similar IOP standard on the same or fewer antiglaucoma medications.Results For GATT (n=10), mean preoperative IOP and number of glaucoma medications were 28.2 +/- 11.2 mm Hg and 4 +/- 0.8 that reduced to 11.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg and 0.7 at 12 months postoperatively, while in the trabeculectomy (n=12) group, they were 27.3 +/- 5.5 mm Hg and 3.6 +/- 0.7 that reduced to 11.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg and 0.5 +/- 0.9, respectively. All eyes (100%) achieved qualified success. Absolute success was 60% and 67.7% by criterion A and 50% and 58.3% by criterion B for GATT and trabeculectomy, respectively. Two eyes in the trabeculectomy group developed hypotony while none of the GATT group had any sight-threatening complications (p=0.4).Conclusions GATT alone demonstrated a significant reduction in IOP and number of glaucoma medications in patients with advanced PG.

AB  - Objective: To assess research trends and publication patterns of literature related to presurgical infant orthopaedics (PSIO) through a bibliometric analysis of the top 100 most-cited articles. Material and methods: The top 100 most-cited articles were identified in the Web of Science (WoS) database using search terms related to PSIO on April 23, 2024, without any restrictions to study design, publication date and language. Standard information about each study was extracted. Citations from WoS, Scopus and PubMed databases were compared. The level of evidence for each article included was assessed. Association between different variables was calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Visual analysis of the author's keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship analysis of authors, and citation analysis of journals and authors were performed using VOSviewer. Results: Top cited articles were published from 1994 to 2020, with total individual database citations being WoS (n = 5378), Scopus (n = 6184) and PubMed (n = 10 450). Eleven articles were considered classic articles. Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Journal (Impact Factor = 1.1) had a maximum number of articles and citations. Two hundred eighty-five individuals contributed to top-cited articles, with 62 corresponding authors from 19 countries. A maximum number of authors were affiliated with universities in the United States. The most common keyword used was "nasoalveolar molding (n = 24)", "cleft palate (n = 16)", and "infant orthopedics (n = 16)". The study design of the majority of articles was retrospective and follow-up studies (level 3; n = 53). A weak negative correlation was observed between citation metrics and both the publication year (P < 0.01) and the level of evidence (P < 0.01). Conclusion: This analysis recognises the contributions of experts and offers valuable insights into trends that have shaped the development and evidence related to PSIO research. Future research should focus on integrating advanced technologies, conducting longitudinal studies, fostering collaboration, and emphasizing patient-centred outcomes.

AB  - PurposeTo describe the features of peripheral retinal degenerations using an Ultra-Widefield (UWF) Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT).MethodIn this cross-sectional study done at a tertiary eye care centre in Northern India, peripheral retinal degenerations such as lattices, snail track lesion, paving stone, White With-Out Pressure(WWOP), micro-cystoid lesions, retinoschisis and other suspicious lesions were identified with clinical examination. Following clinical examination, these eyes with peripheral retinal degenerations underwent UWF OCT.Results100 eyes with 14 peripheral lesions like lattices (31%), snail track lesions (10.4%), peripheral retinoschisis (7.5%), non-specific pigmented doubtful lesions (13.2%), WWOP (7.5%), paving stone (6.6%), peripheral retinal detachment (3.8%) along with CHRPE, micro-cystoid lesions and dark without pressure areas were identified. All the lesions could be imaged with the help of UWF-OCT. It significantly helped in improving diagnostic capability with early identification of specific structural features such as vitreoretinal attachment and traction, full-thickness hole or tear, and sub-retinal fluid which were not so evident on indirect ophthalmoscopy.ConclusionUWF-OCT deepens our understanding of the structure of the retina and its associated peripheral pathologies, allowing early recognition of vision-threatening lesions that may influence clinical management.

TI  - Thromboelastography-Guided versus Standard-of-Care or On-Demand Platelet Transfusion in Patients with Cirrhosis and Thrombocytopenia Undergoing Procedures: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Purpose: To determine the rate of platelet transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <50 x 10(9)/L) undergoing high-risk invasive procedures when prescribed by thromboelastography (TEG) compared with empirical and on-demand transfusion strategies. Materials and Methods: This was a single-center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures were randomized into 3 groups: TEG group, transfusions based on TEG parameters; standard of care (SOC) group, 3 units of random donor platelets before procedure; and on-demand group, transfusions based on procedural adverse events/clinician's discretion. The primary outcome was periprocedural platelet transfusion in each arm. Results: Eighty-seven patients were randomized (29 in each group) with no significant differences in demographics/coagulation profile/procedures. The median platelet count was 33 x 10(9)/L (interquartile range, 26-43 x 10(9)/L). Percutaneous liver biopsy was the most common procedure (46, 52.9%). Significantly lower number of patients in the TEG group received platelets (4 cases, 13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9-31.7) compared with SOC group (100%; 95% CI, 88.1-100; P < .001). Four patients in the on-demand group received platelets (13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9-31.7). Minor (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade 2) procedure-related bleeding occurred in 3 (10%; 95% CI, 2.2-27.4) patients in the TEG-guided transfusion group compared with 1 (3.4%; 95% CI, 0.1-17.8) patient each in the SOC and on-demand groups (P = .43), although the study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates. No bleeding-related mortality was observed in any of the 3 groups. Conclusions: TEG-prescribed transfusion reduced prophylactic transfusions in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures. The study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates.

TI  - Antiseptic efficacy and plasma chlorhexidine levels following two different methods of application of 1% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate for skin disinfection in preterm newborns: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: Many neonatal units have started using Chlorhexidine gluconate for neonatal skin antisepsis. However, there is in-vitro evidence of inhibition of neurite growth. The current study aimed to compare two methods of its local application, for the extent of systemic absorption and antiseptic efficacy. Study design: Parallel group, blinded, randomised trial, at a Level III, neonatal intensive care unit. Between December 2020 to July 2022, neonates from 28 to 34 weeks gestation, were randomized to local skin antisepsis by either- (a) 1% aqueous chlorhexidine (CHG aq) followed by cleansing off the residual agent with sterile water swab (Cleansing group) or (b)1% CHG aq followed by air drying (No cleansing group). The outcome measures were the proportion of post antisepsis skin swabs with no/insignificant growth, and the plasma chlorhexidine levels. Results: Of the total of 457 enrollments (Cleansing: n = 230; No Cleansing: n = 227), 216 (93.91%) in "Cleansing" vs. 221 (97.36%) in "No cleansing" (risk difference -3.45%, 95% CI -7.2 to 0.28%; p = 0.072) had no/insignificant growth post-antisepsis. The lower bound of the confidence interval crossed the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 5%. The median (IQR) plasma chlorhexidine levels were not significantly different between the two groups (7.9 (5.6, 17.9)) ng/mL in Cleansing vs. 6.5 (4.6, 17.7) in No cleansing groups (p = 0.437). Conclusion: Cleansing with sterile water after application of chlorhexidine in preterm neonates was not shown to be non-inferior compared to no cleansing, for skin antisepsis efficacy. Systemic absorption occurred to a similar extent despite cleansing off the residual agent.

AB  - Purpose Screening tests are the cornerstone for early detection and optimal management of cancers. Most of the present cancer-screening tests are intrusive, time-consuming, and specifically target a particular anatomical site or cancer type. Only a few studies have reported the objective measures of F-18-FDG PET-based cancer screening in asymptomatic individuals. This review and meta-analysis is an attempt to assess the applicability and performance of F-18-FDG PET-based modalities for whole-body cancer screening. Materials and methods The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following PRISMA guidelines. Literature searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were conducted using relevant MeSH terms and keywords, for articles published in the last 2 decades (2000-2022). Pooled estimates of diagnostic test accuracy-including sensitivity, specificity, positive-likelihood ratio, negative-likelihood ratio, and hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) curve were generated using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. Results Seventeen studies were included in the systematic review and 13 studies were deemed eligible for meta-analysis. The mean estimates of pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive-likelihood ratio, negative-likelihood ratio, and Odds ratio using F-18-FDG PET with a 95% confidence interval were 0.47 (0.25-0.69), 0.97 (0.95-0.98), 18.8 (6.8-51.5), 0.45 (0.27-0.76), 41.0 (7.9-211.8) and for F-18-FDG PET/CT were 0.83 (0.75-0.88), 0.98 (0.97-0.99), 49.7 (29.2-84.5), 0.15 (0.8-0.28), 329.9 (125.0-870.8), respectively. Among screening modalities, F-18-FDG PET/CT had a higher accuracy i.e., the area under the HSROC curve (AUC): 0.91 (0.87-0.95) compared to F-18-FDG PET: 0.72 (0.61-0.82). Conclusion This study demonstrates that currently F-18-FDG PET-based screening has limited applicability for population-based cancer-screening programs. However, it has a promising role as a combined screening strategy for at-risk individuals and allows for comprehensive diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in high-resource settings.

AB  - Aims This study aims to assess the potential bacterial inactivation pathway triggered by argon (Ar) cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (CAPJ) discharge using spectroscopic and imaging techniques. Methods and results Electrical and reactive species of the Ar CAPJ discharge was characterized. The chemical composition and morphology of bacteria pre- and post-CAPJ exposure were assessed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman micro-spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A greater than 6 log reduction of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved within 60 and 120 s of CAPJ exposure, respectively. Extremely low D-values (<20 s) were recorded for both the isolates. The alterations in the FTIR spectra and Raman micro-spectra signals of post-CAPJ exposed bacteria revealed the degree of destruction at the molecular level, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, bond breakages, etc. Further, TEM images of exposed bacteria indicated the incurred damages on cell morphology by CAPJ reactive species. Also, the inactivation process varied for both isolates, as evidenced by the correlation between the inactivation curve and FTIR spectra. It was observed that the identified gas-phase reactive species, such as Ar I, O I, OH center dot, NO+, OH+, NO2-, NO3-, etc. played a significant role in bacterial inactivation. Conclusions This study clearly demonstrated the effect of CAPJ exposure on bacterial cell morphology and molecular composition, illuminating potential bacterial inactivation mechanisms.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is often diagnosed at a very advanced stage due to its location and non-specific initial symptoms. Moreover, no clinically useful serological marker has been established so far for early detection of NPC. In this study, we have investigated the clinical significance of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA load along with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels to evaluate if these three all together can be useful as a strong serological marker for early detection and prediction of treatment response in patients with NPC. Plasma EBV DNA load, IL-6 level, VEGF expressions were measured in 24 patients with NPC at presentation and various time points during and after treatment. There was a positive correlation between high plasma EBV DNA load with higher IL-6 and VEGF expression, which was closely associated with therapeutic response as well. Persistent or recurrent plasma EBV load with higher IL-6 and VEGF levels can potentially predict disease progression and may be useful to select patients for additional therapy and longer follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To study serum interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8) and interleukin-10(IL-10) levels in Epilpetic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep(EE-SWAS), drug refractory epilepsy(DRE) and well controlled epilepsy(WCE). Methods: Children(2-12 years) with immunotherapy na & iuml;ve EE-SWAS, DRE and WCE were enrolled. Valid psychometric tools were used to assess cognition and behavior. Children with EE-SWAS were longitudinally followed. They received a three-month steroid course alongwith the ongoing antiseizure drugs. Electroclinical responders were defined as change in social quotient by 5-points with improvement in atleast one behavioral domain by 5-points and 50 % reduction in mean seizure frequency if active seizures were present alongwith a 25 % reduction in Spike-wave-index(SWI) at three months. Change in serum Interleukin levels at one month follow up was compared between participants who eventually became responders or non-responders at three months. Results: Twenty children with EE-SWAS, 18 with DRE and WCE each were enrolled. Serum IL-6(pg/ml){(EE-SWAS: 3.775(IQR 2.205, 11.28); DRE: 3.01(IQR 2.04, 4.56); WCE: 1.655(IQR 1.27, 2.29), p = 0.0065} and IL-8(pg/ml){(EE-SWAS: 103.2(IQR 34.01, 200.82); DRE: 19.595(IQR 16.54, 39.7); WCE: 18.97(IQR 16.54, 21.91) p = 0.0002} was significantly different between the three groups. In EE-SWAS group 12/20(60 %) showed electroclinical response to steroids. Responders had significant reduction in IL6 levels (pg/ml){4.045(IQR 2.605, 18.96) to 1.13(IQR 054, 1.74)} at one month follow up compared to non responders {3.12(IQR 1.655, 5.27) to 4.37(IQR 2.83, 9.855)} (p = 0.0069). Conclusions: Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) are significantly elevated in EE-SWAS compared to DRE and WCE. Reduction in IL-6 levels at one month post-therapy predicted electroclinical responders at 3months follow up.

AB  - Withania coagulans (WC) is used in traditional and Ayurveda medicine to treat various ailments, including diabetes. Our investigation found that WC fruit hexane extract effectively suppresses alpha-glucosidase activity (IC50 50 = 0.013 mg/ml, Ki i = 0.012 mg/ml). The purified molecule has an IC50 50 of 0.004 mg/ml and Ki i of 0.0037 mg/ml. FTIR examination indicates distinctive peaks at 3500, 2900, 1770, and 1500 cm-- 1 corresponding to functional groups OH bending, C-H - H stretching, C--O - - O stretching, and C-O - O stretching. GCMS analysis reveals plant secondary metabolites (PSM) such as n-hexadecenoic acid and methyl 9,10-octadecadienoate. NMR confirms the existence of olefinic fatty acids. The bioactive fraction recorded a non-competitive mode of inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity. The cytotoxicity exhibited against HELA cell was IC50 50 0.4 mg/ml and found positive in inhibiting the growth of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. . Additionally, ensemble docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that, out of the four PSMs examined, methyl 12,13-tetradecadienoate interacted with the alpha-glucosidase enzyme's allosteric site (BE-128.78 kJ/mol) and changed the configurations of the catalytic sites, as demonstrated by the enzyme's decreased affinity for isomaltose. The study found that PSMs from WC fruit may inhibit alpha-glucosidase, making them viable candidates for antidiabetic medication development.

AB  - Cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) are reported to occur with very high rates of incidence and exhibit high morbidity and mortality rates across the globe. Therefore, research is focused on searching for novel therapeutic targets involving multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the development and progression of various CVDs, such as hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and myocardial infarction. Among multiple pathways generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), NADPH defines all abbreviations oxidases of the NOX family as the major source of ROS generation and plays an intricate role in the development and progression of CVDs. Therefore, exploring the role of different NADPH oxidase isoforms in various cardiovascular pathologies has attracted attention to current cardiovascular research. Focusing on NADPH oxidases to reduce oxidative stress in managing diverse CVDs may offer unique therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat various heart conditions. The current review article highlights the role of different NADPH oxidase isoforms in the pathophysiology of various CVDs. Moreover, the focus is also to emphasize different experimental studies that utilized various NADPH oxidase isoform modulators to manage other disorders. The present review article considers new avenues for researchers/scientists working in the field of cardiovascular pharmacology utilizing NADPH oxidase isoform modulators.

AB  - Tuberculosis is a global threat and is still a leading cause of death due to an infectious agent. The infection is spread through inhalation of M. tb containing aerosol droplets. Bacteria after reaching the lung alveoli are engulfed by alveolar macrophages, leading to an immune response. Then, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released by these macrophages, recruiting other antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells. These cells phagocytose the bacteria and present mycobacterial antigens to na & iuml;ve T cells. After activation by DCs, T cells differentiate into various T cells subsets, viz. CD4(+), CD8(+), Th17, Treg, Tfh cells and others display enormous diversification in their characteristics and functions. This review comprises a comprehensive literature on conventional and unconventional T cells, highlighting the polyfunctional T cells as well, their role in controlling TB infection, and their implications in the spectrum of TB infection. While some subsets such as CD4(+ )T cells are extensively studied, some T cell subsets such as gamma delta T cells and Tfh cells remain poorly understood in the pathophysiology of tuberculosis, despite having significant potential implications. The goal of TB eradication can be assisted by development of better vaccines against TB, which can effectively induce a robust and longterm T cells memory. The same has been discussed in the latter part of this review. BCG being the standalone commercialised TB vaccine so far has its limitations. Strategies for the enhancement of BCG along with novel studies in vaccine development, has also been discussed in great detail. Lastly, T cells display a complex interplay of an adaptive immune response against TB, with activation and enhancement of the innate immune responses. Therefore, it is critical to fully understand the role of various T cells subsets in pathophysiology of tuberculosis to provide better therapeutic inventions and improve patient care.

AB  - Background and aim: Basic differentiation between an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-type colitis and a non-IBD type of colitis is the essential histological pre-requisite before further subclassifications are made. The combination of mucosal prominent eosinophilic cell infiltrate along with basal plasmacytosis is supposed to be a useful histological feature that can differentiate between IBD-type and non-IBD-type colitis. Hence, this systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to assess the reliability of mucosal basal plasmacytosis and eosinophilia for histological differentiation of IBD-type versus non-IBD-type colitis. Methods: We searched the PROSPERO, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from January 1, 2000 to July 30, 2022 for all types of studies (prospective, cross-sectional, or retrospective studies) having histological features (including mucosal basal plasmacytosis, eosinophilia, and neutrophilic infiltration) in IBD and/or non-IBD colitis cases. Two reviewers extracted data, which were aggregated using random-effects models. Results: The 59 selected articles were evaluated for the predecided parameters. Both basal plasmacytosis and lamina propria plasmacytosis did not show any significant correlation between IBD-type and non-IBD-type colitis. The proportions for basal plasmacytosis with 95% CI were 0.50 (0.19-0.82) in IBD-type colitis and 0.46 (0.40-0.52) in non-IBD-type colitis, with a P value of .79. The proportion of lamina propria plasmacytosis with 95% CI was 0.67 (0.42-0.92) in IBD and 0.60 (0.35-0.85) in non-IBD-type colitis, with a P value being .7. Conclusions: This systematic review documented the dearth of published data on key histological features such as basal plasmacytosis and mucosal eosinophilia which are believed to differentiate between IBD-type and non-IBD-type colitis.

AB  - Informed by the almost unimaginable unmet need for cardiac surgery in the developing regions of the world, leading surgeons, cardiologists, editors in chief of the major cardiothoracic journals as well as representatives of medical industry and government convened in December 2017 to address this unacceptable disparity in access to care. The ensuing " Cape Town Declaration" " constituted a clarion call to cardiac surgical societies to jointly advocate the strengthening of sustainable, local cardiac surgical capacity in the developing world. The Cardiac Surgery Inter- society Alliance (CSIA) was thus created, comprising The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (ASCVTS), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the World Heart Federation (WHF). The guiding principle was advocacy for sustainable cardiac surgical capacity in lowincome countries. As a fi rst step, a global needs assessment confirmed fi rmed rheumatic heart disease as the overwhelming pathology requiring cardiac surgery in these regions. Subsequently, CSIA published a request for proposals to support fl edgling programs that could demonstrate the backing by their governments and health care institution. Out of 11 applicants, and following an evaluation of the sites, including site visits to the 3 fi nalists, Mozambique and Rwanda were selected as the fi rst Pilot Sites. Subsequently, a mentorship and training agreement was completed between Mozambique and the University of Cape Town, a middle- income country with a comparable burden of rheumatic heart disease. The agreement entails regular video calls between the heart teams, targeted training across all aspects of cardiac surgery, as well as on-site presence of mentoring teams for complex cases with the strict observance of " assisting only." " In Rwanda, Team Heart, a US and Rwanda-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) that has been performing cardiac surgery in Rwanda and helping to train the cardiac surgery workforce since 2008, has agreed to continue providing mentorship for the local team and to assist in the establishment of independent cardiac surgery with all that entails. This involves intermittent virtual conferences between Rwandan and US cardiologists for surgical case selection. Five years after CSIA was founded, its " Seal of Approval" " for the sustainability of endorsed programs in Mozambique and Rwanda has resulted in higher case numbers, a stronger government commitment, significant fi cant upgrades of infrastructure, the nurturing of generous consumable donations by industry and the commencement of negotiations with global donors for major grants. Extending the CSIA Seal to additional deserving programs could further align the international cardiac surgical community with the principle of local cardiac surgery capacity-building in developing countries.

AB  - Background: Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is suitable for use on a range of cytology preparations, such as cell blocks, air-dried slides, ethanol-fixed slides, direct smears, cytospins, and liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples. However, it must be standardized against the gold standard of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues with adequate number of positive and negative controls. The role of ICC in lung cancer is crucial, as most lung cancer specimens are cytology samples. Accurate diagnosis and testing of certain biomarkers rely heavily on both diagnostic and predictive ICC. Summary: Key ICC markers important in lung cancer include, but are not limited to, diagnostic ICCs such as TTF-1, p40, Napsin A, and p63, as well as predictive ICCs like ALK, ROS-1, PD-L1, and NTRK. Key Messages: With proper validation, immunocytochemistry for lung cancer can be effectively performed on direct smears, cytospins, and other specimens, even when resources for preparing cell blocks are unavailable. This is particularly true for diagnostic antibodies, but it is important to exercise caution with predictive ICC. Nonetheless, a low threshold for molecular testing should be maintained. PD-L1 ICC can be challenging and should ideally be performed on formalin-fixed cell blocks or biopsies when available. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody production, complement activation, and immune complex deposition. SLE predominantly affects young, middle-aged, and child-bearing women with episodes of flare-up and remission, although it affects males at a much lower frequency (female: male; 7:1 to 15:1). Technological and molecular advancements have helped in patient stratification and improved patient prognosis, morbidity, and treatment regimens overall, impacting quality of life. Despite several attempts to comprehend the pathogenesis of SLE, knowledge about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this disease is still lacking. The current treatment options for SLE are pragmatic and aim to develop composite biomarkers for daily practice, which necessitates the robust development of novel treatment strategies and drugs targeting specific responsive pathways. In this communication, we review and aim to explore emerging therapeutic modalities, including multiomics-based approaches, rational drug design, and CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy, for the management of SLE.

AB  - Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor diagnosed mostly in children below the age of five years and comprises of about 15 % of all paediatric cancer deaths. Tumor initiating cancer stem cells (CSCs) can be targeted for better treatment approaches. BASP1-AS1 is a long non coding (Lnc) RNA that is a divergent LncRNA for its coding gene brain abundant membrane attached signal protein 1 (BASP1). We had earlier demonstrated it to be expressed in foetus derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), where it was a positive regulator of BASP1 and was critical for neural differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the role of BASP1-AS1 in CSCs derived from the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. We cultured SH-SY5Y cells on Poly-D-Lysine coated flasks in serum free media supplemented with growth factors, which led to the enrichment of CSCs as determined by marker expression. When grown on ultra-low attachment flasks, these cells formed CSCs enriched neurospheres. We examined the effects of BASP1-AS1 siRNA mediated knockdown on CSCs enriched SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y derived neurospheres. BASP1-AS1 knockdown decreased the levels of the corresponding gene BASP1 and the rate of cell proliferation of CSCs enriched cells along with low expression of Ki67. It also reduced the mRNA levels of stem cell and pluripotency gene markers (CD133, CD44, c-KIT, SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG), as also Wnt 2 and the Wnt pathway effector beta catenin. It also abrogated the formation of neurospheres in ultra-low attachment flasks. A similar effect on proliferation and stemness related properties was seen on BASP1 knockdown. BASP1-AS1 and its related pathways may provide a point of intervention for the CSCs population in neuroblastoma.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.

AB  - In the south Asian region, delivering non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control services through existing primary health-care (PHC) facilities is urgently required yet currently challenging. As the first point of contact with the health-care system, PHC offers an ideal window for prevention and continuity of care over the life course, yet the implementation of PHC to address NCDs is insufficient. This review considers evidence from five south Asian countries to derive policy-relevant recommendations for designing integrated PHC systems that include NCD care. Findings reveal high political commitment but poor multisectoral engagement and health systems preparedness for tackling chronic diseases at the PHC level. There is a shortage of skilled human resources, requisite infrastructure, essential NCD medicines and technologies, and dedicated financing. Although innovations supporting integrated interventions exist, such as innovations focusing on community-centric approaches, scaling up remains problematic. To deliver NCD services sustainably, governments must aim for increased financing and a redesign of PHC service.

AB  - Many of the daily systemic medications (parenteral and oral) used to treat various diseases are known to cause ocular toxicities - leading to vision loss. How these medications gain entry into the eye despite the ocular barriers is an important question to be addressed. Various reports show almost 30-40 % of systemic drugs causing ocular toxicity are organic cation in nature. We hypothesize these systemic drugs (cations) are non-specifically recognized as endogenous substrates by organic cation transporter (OCT1) in the lacrimal gland, thereby facilitating its entry into the anterior eye segment. Therefore, we studied the expression and localization of OCT1 in the lacrimal gland of rabbits. Further, to prove our hypothesis, OCT1 substrates (known as well as predicted from our previous Artificial Intelligence study) were administered intravenously in the presence and absence of topically administered OCT1 blockers. Our findings show, OCT1 gene and protein expression in the lacrimal gland, with its localization in the terminal acinar cells. The tear levels of intravenously administered substrates decreased in the presence of topical OCT1 blockers, indicating - a) the entry of systemic drugs into the eye via lacrimal secretion and b) OCT1 in the lacrimal gland is involved in the drug transport (substrates) from blood to the eye. Though the role of transporters in toxicity is well-known, the current study opens a new avenue for understanding the role of transporters in ocular toxicity.

AB  - South Asia is rapidly urbanising. The strains of rapid urbanisation have profound implications for the health and equity of urban populations. This Series paper examines primary health care (PHC) in south Asian cities. Health and its social determinants vary considerably across south Asian cities and substantial socioeconomic inequities are present. Although cities offer easy geographical access to PHC services, financial hardship associated with health care use and low quality of care are a concern, particularly for low-income residents. Providing better PHC in south Asia requires a multi-sectoral response, with effective and resourced urban local bodies; increased public financing for health care; and new service delivery models aimed at low-income urban communities that involve strengthening public sector services, strengthening government engagement with private providers where necessary, and engaging with low-income communities and the PHC providers that serve them.

AB  - Liquid biopsy for CNS tumors is in its nascent phase, hindered by the low levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Overcoming this challenge requires highly sensitive molecular techniques. DD-PCR emerges as a standout technique due to its ability to identify rare mutations, copy number variations, and circulating nucleic acids, making it one of the best methods for identifying somatic mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Despite promising results from various studies demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining informative ctDNA profiles from liquid biopsy samples, challenges persist, including the need to standardize sample collection, storage, and processing methods, define clear assay positivity thresholds, and address the overall low assay sensitivity. Our two-phase study began by assessing DD-PCR efficacy in FFPE tissues, revealing robust concordance with immunohistochemistry. In Phase 1 (85 cases), DD-PCR on FFPE tissues demonstrated 100 % sensitivity and specificity for IDH1 R132H mutations. In Phase 2 (100 cases), analysis extended to cfDNA, maintaining high specificity (100 %) with moderate sensitivity (44.2 %). Overall concordance with immunohistochemistry was 61 %, highlighting liquid biopsy's potential in glioma management. The findings emphasized DD-PCR's clinical utility in both tissue and liquid biopsy, underscoring its role in early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of diffuse gliomas.

AB  - Increased iron level is detected in rat kidney and human urine in diabetic condition and implicated in associated nephropathy. However, the biological cue and mechanism of the iron accumulation remain unclear. Here we reveal that glucose increases iron uptake by promoting transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) in kidney cells by a translational mechanism but does not alter expression of endosomal iron transporter DMT1. Glucose decreases iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) by a protein degradation mechanism. Hepcidin is known to bind at Cys-326 residue in promoting degradation of human ferroportin. When Cys-326 was mutated to Ser in human-FPNFLAG and expressed in kidney cells, glucose still could degrade FPN-FLAG implicating involvement of hepcidin independent mechanism in glucose induced ferroportin degradation. Chronic hyperglycemia was generated in rats by administering streptozotocin (STZ) with periodic insulin injection to determine the level of iron homeostasis components. Increased TFRC and decreased ferroportin levels were detected in hyperglycemic rat kidney by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Hepcidin mRNA was not significantly altered in kidney but was marginally decreased in liver. Perls' staining and non-heme iron estimation showed an elevated iron level in hyperglycemic rat kidney. These results suggest that high glucose dysregulates iron transport components resulting iron accumulation in diabetic kidney.

Thyroid sarcomas, primary or secondary, are exceptionally rare with only a handful of case reports documented so far. The challenges lie in the fact that certain primary thyroid malignancies of epithelial origin may exhibit spindle cell morphology, making them difficult to differentiate from thyroid sarcomas. Despite the morphological similarities, discerning between these entities is crucial due to their distinct treatment and management implications. This report documents a series of unusual types of sarcoma in the thyroid gland. The aim is to explore the peculiarities of these lesions, the diagnostic challenges faced as well to study the potential implications for both clinicians and patients.

AB  - Oncocytic renal neoplasms are a major source of diagnostic challenge in genitourinary pathology; however, they are typically nonaggressive in general, raising the question of whether distinguishing different subtypes, including emerging entities, is necessary. Emerging entities recently described include eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESC RCC), low-grade oncocytic tumor (LOT), eosinophilic vacuolated tumor (EVT), and papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity (PRNRP). A survey was shared among 65 urologic pathologists using SurveyMonkey.com (Survey Monkey, Santa Clara, CA, USA). De-identified and anonymized respondent data were analyzed. Sixty-three participants completed the survey and contributed to the study. Participants were from Asia (n = 21; 35%), North America (n = 31; 52%), Europe (n = 6; 10%), and Australia (n = 2; 3%). Half encounter oncocytic renal neoplasms that are difficult to classify monthly or more frequently. Most (70%) indicated that there is enough evidence to consider ESC RCC as a distinct entity now, whereas there was less certainty for LOT (27%), EVT (29%), and PRNRP (37%). However, when combining the responses for sufficient evidence currently and likely in the future, LOT and EVT yielded > 70% and > 60% for PRNRP. Most (60%) would not render an outright diagnosis of oncocytoma on needle core biopsy. There was a dichotomy in the routine use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the evaluation of oncocytoma (yes = 52%; no = 48%). The most utilized IHC markers included keratin 7 and 20, KIT, AMACR, PAX8, CA9, melan A, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)B, and fumarate hydratase (FH). Genetic techniques used included TSC1/TSC2/MTOR (67%) or TFE3 (74%) genes and pathways; however, the majority reported using these very rarely. Only 40% have encountered low-grade oncocytic renal neoplasms that are deficient for FH. Increasing experience with the spectrum of oncocytic renal neoplasms will likely yield further insights into the most appropriate work-up, classification, and clinical management for these entities.

AB  - Purpose To observe the variability in the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profiles of first-line antitubercular drugs in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients aged 18-60 years with or without DM were included in the study. Group I (n = 20) included patients with TB, whereas group II (n = 20) included patients with both TB and DM. After 2 weeks of therapy, plasma concentrations and other PK-PD parameters were determined. Improvements in clinical features, X-ray findings, sputum conversion, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed after 2 months of therapy. Results Isoniazid displayed non-significantly higher plasma concentrations in diabetic patients, along with a significantly (P < 0.05) longer elimination half-life (t(1/2)). Rifampicin plasma concentrations at 4, 8, and 12 h were significantly (P < 0.05) lower, and it displayed significantly (P < 0.05) lower area under the curve (AUC(0-12) and AUC(0-infinity)), shorter t(1/2), higher clearance (Cl), and a lower AUC(0-infinity)/MIC ratio in diabetic patients. Pyrazinamide and ethambutol showed non-significantly higher plasma concentrations, AUC(0-12), AUC(0-infinity), and t(1/2) in diabetic patients. The improvements in clinical features, X-ray findings, sputum conversion, and ADRs were comparable in both groups. Conclusions The presence of DM in TB patients affects the PK-PD parameters of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol variably in the Indian population. Studies with a larger number of patients are required to further elucidate the role of DM on the PK-PD profile of first-line antitubercular drugs and treatment outcomes in TB patients with concomitant DM.

AB  - Background: Obesity is an important predictor of development of Lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) and its symptoms. LCS further restricts the mobility of the patient and a vicious cycle develops. The operative decision on patients with LCS and obesity is a matter of debate. Hence, we attempted to compare changes in body mass index and patient satisfaction in patients with LCS with and without concomitant obesity, undergoing spinal decompression surgery. Methods: Patients undergoing decompression for LCS between 1st June 2019 to 31st May 2020 were included. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, co-morbidities, BMI, self-recorded maximal walking distance (SRMWD) and Oswestry disability index score (ODI) were recorded. All patients were followed up prospectively at 1 year post surgery. Satisfaction was recorded on a five-point Likert scale. Participants were classified into non obesity (group 1) and obesity (group 2) groups according to JAPI and WHO classification and compared. Results: 55 patients met the inclusion criteria, 23 in group 1 and 32 in group 2. Group 2 showed a mean decrease in BMI of 0.95 +/- 1.32 kg/m2 2 while other group had an increase of 0.14 +/- 1.31 kg/m2 2 (p = 0.021). Significant weight change was seen in 31.3 % group 2 vs 8.7 % group 1 patients which was significant (p = 0.046). Pre operative BMI positively correlated with change in BMI after surgery (r = 0.406, p = 0.001) and with percentage weight reduction (r = 0.321, p = 0.017). Both the groups were comparable in improvement in ODI and SR-MWD scores and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Patients with obesity achieve significant reduction in weight and BMI following decompression surgery for LCS. It will further prevent other health conditions attributed to obesity. Both the groups were comparable in ODI, SR-MWD and satisfactory outcome following surgery. Hence obesity should not be a deterring factor for surgical consideration for patients with lumbar canal stenosis.

AB  - Introduction: Up to 40% of patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) have a negative prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging (nMRI), and up to 15% of them may have clinically significant PCa (csPCa). The ability to predict the presence of csPCa despite nMRI may help avoid unnecessary biopsies. We aimed to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI, the influence of MRI reporting patterns in clinical practice, and the factors that might predict csPCa among men with an nMRI. Methodology: In an IRB-approved, ambispective study, men who underwent prostate biopsy from 2016 to 2023 and had a prebiopsy MRI, were included to determine the presence of csPCa. The reporting patterns of institutional and noninstitutional MRI were evaluated. Age, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, prostate specific antigen (PSA), PSA density (PSAD), and MRI reports were evaluated for their ability to predict csPCa in men with nMRI. Results: 1660 patients who underwent prostate biopsy were assessed for eligibility, and 685 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age, PSA and PSAD were 60 years, 11.63 ng/ml and 0.23 ng/ml/ cm3, respectively. 62 (9%) men had an nMRI, among which csPCa, non-csPCa, and negative biopsy were found in 34%, 5%, and 61% of men, respectively. 61% had an institutional MRI, while 39% had a noninstitutional MRI. The sensitivity and NPV of any MRI for csPCa were 93% and 66%, respectively, which improved to 96% and 81% for institutional MRI. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed abnormal DRE and PSAD >= 0.25 ng/ml/cc as predictive factors for csPCa in men with an nMRI. Conclusion: 34% of men with negative MRIs were found to harbor csPCa on prostate biopsy. The NPV of institutional MRI was higher than for noninstitutional MRI. Men with an abnormal DRE or PSAD >= 0.25 ng/ml/cc had a higher incidence of csPCa despite an nMRI. (c) 2024 The Asian Pacific Prostate Society. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction:<bold> </bold>To evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of ZRC-3277 (pertuzumab biosimilar) with Perjeta (R) (pertuzumab) in previously untreated patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and methods:<bold> </bold>This phase III, multicenter, double-blind study across 38 sites in India randomized (1:1) patients with HER2-positive MBC in either the ZRC-3277 or Perjeta (R) group. Both groups also received trastuzumab and docetaxel. Of 268 enrolled patients, mITT population had 243 patients (119 and 124 in the ZRC-3277 and Perjeta (R) groups, respectively). The primary objective was to compare the between-group objective response rate (ORR) after 6 cycles of treatment. ORR was determined by evaluating scans of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging following Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST 1.1). Two-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference in ORR was determined to evaluate the noninferiority of ZRC-3277 to Perjeta (R). The secondary outcomes included the assessment of PK, immunogenicity, and safety between the 2 groups. Results: In the mITT population, 104 (87.39%) and 114 (91.94%) participants achieved the ORR in the ZRC-3277 and Perjeta (R) groups, respectively. For predefined -15% noninferiority margin, obtained 2-sided 95% CIs (-12.19%, 3.11%) for the difference in ORR (-4.55%) between the 2 groups demonstrated the noninferiority of ZRC-3277 to Perjeta (R).

AB  - BackgroundCrescentic glomerulonephritis, if not managed promptly, is associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. There are limited studies reporting the outcomes of crescentic glomerulonephritis in children.ObjectivesThis systematic review is aimed at synthesizing the data on etiology, clinical profile, and outcomes of crescentic glomerulonephritis in children.Data sourcesWe performed a literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to January 2024 without language or geographic restrictions.Study eligibility criteriaCohort and cross-sectional studies with at least 10 participants reporting etiology, clinical features, and outcomes on crescentic glomerulonephritis in children were considered eligible.Participants and interventionsChildren aged less than 18 years with crescentic glomerulonephritis.Study appraisal and synthesis methodsWe used a tool by Hoy et al. for assessing the quality of studies. We calculated pooled estimates using random effect meta-analyses. Primary outcome was the pooled proportion of patients progressing to kidney failure.ResultsFrom 1706 records, we included 36 studies (1548 participants) from 16 countries. Etiology was immune-complex glomerulonephritis in 76% (95% CI 67 to 85), pauci-immune in 19% (13 to 25), and anti-GBM disease in 5% (3 to 7) of patients. Gross hematuria, oliguria, edema, and hypertension were observed in 63% (41 to 82), 57% (34 to 79), 79% (65 to 90), and 64% (49 to 77), respectively. In-hospital mortality, reported in 11 studies, was 7% (4 to 11). Progression to kidney failure and chronic kidney disease was reported in 27% (21 to 33) and 50% (29 to 71) of patients, respectively. Risk factors for kidney failure included oliguria, dialysis requirement at onset, estimated GFR, proportion of fibrous crescents, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis as the underlying etiology.LimitationsHigh heterogeneity in pooled estimates of the outcomes.Conclusions and implications of key findingsImmune-complex glomerulonephritis is the most common etiology in children, with edema, hypertension, gross hematuria, and oliguria being the chief presenting manifestations. Almost one in every four patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis progressed to kidney failure.Systematic review registration numberPROSPERO registration number CRD42024500515.Graphical abstractA higher-resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information

AB  - Background Next-generation sequencing has enabled non-invasive diagnosis of type IV collagen disease in clinical settings other than the typical presentation of Alport syndrome (AS). Methods We reviewed the clinical and histological records of children diagnosed with Alport syndrome based on next-generation sequencing. Variants on clinical exome sequencing were categorized using ACMG 2015 criteria. Results During 2015-2023, we found 43 patients (34 boys) with 39 variants in COL4A5 (n = 27), COL4A4 (n = 7), and COL4A3 (n = 5). Thirty, 8, and 5 patients had X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant disease, respectively. The median (IQR) age and eGFR at diagnosis were 10 (7-13) years and 100.1 (59-140) ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. Fifteen patients were initially diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Alport syndrome was suspected in these patients due to persistent microscopic hematuria, eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), characteristic histology, and/or non-response to immunosuppression. Of 26 patients who underwent kidney biopsy, light microscopy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 9, 9, and 8 patients, respectively. Electron microscopy (n = 18) showed characteristic glomerular basement membrane changes and/or foot process effacement in 12 and 16 cases, respectively. Twenty-one patients (48.8%) had high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, while two had lenticonus. Twelve patients progressed to chronic kidney disease stages 4-5. Median survival (IQR) with eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was 15.6 (13-18) years. Conclusions The phenotype of Alport syndrome varies from asymptomatic urinary abnormalities to hematuria, proteinuria and/or low eGFR, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Adverse outcomes are common, especially in boys with X-linked disease.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, particularly for hematologic malignancies. Various cancer immunotherapy strategies are presently being explored, including cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulators monoclonal antibodies, etc. The therapy has shown impressive efficacy in treating conditions such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and multiple myeloma, often leading to complete remission in refractory cases. However, the clinical application of CAR T-cell therapy is accompanied by challenges, notably severe side effects. Effective management of these adverse effects requires meticulous monitoring and prompt intervention, highlighting the critical role of nursing in this therapeutic process. Nurses play a crucial role in patient education, monitoring, symptom management, care coordination, and psychosocial support, ensuring safe and effective treatment. As research advances and new CAR T-cell therapies are developed, the role of nursing professionals remains pivotal in optimizing patient outcomes. The continued evolution of CAR T-cell therapy promises improved outcomes, with nursing professionals integral to its success.

AB  - Although epidural catheter insertion under ultrasound (US) guidance in the pediatric age group has been reported in the literature, it is yet to be adopted widely in clinical practice. The incomplete fusion of bones in pediatric patients provides an acoustic window for the US. The epidural space in children is at shallow depth, hence a high-frequency probe, which provides better resolution can be used. We present a case series in which real-time US-guided epidural catheter placement was performed in 10 infants in lower thoracic and upper lumbar interspaces. We reiterate that the use of real-time US during epidural catheter placement in patients increases the success rate of epidural catheter placement while decreasing procedural complications.

AB  - Mitochondria-targeting agents, known as mitocans, are emerging as potent cancer therapeutics due to pronounced metabolic and apoptotic adaptations in the mitochondria of cancer cells. ONC212, an imipridone-family compound initially identified as a ClpP agonist, is currently under investigation as a potential mitocan with demonstrated preclinical efficacy against multiple malignancies. Despite this efficacy, the molecular mechanism underlying the cell death induced by ONC212 remains unclear. This study systematically investigates the mitochondrial involvement and signaling cascades associated with ONC212-induced cell death, utilizing HeLa and A549 cancer cells. Treated cancer cells exhibited characteristic apoptotic features, such as annexin-V positivity and caspase-3 activation; however, these occurred independently of typical mitochondrial events like membrane potential loss (Delta Psi m) and cytochrome c release, as well as caspase-8 activation associated with the extrinsic pathway. Additionally, ONC212 treatment increased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which impeded apoptosis, as the overexpression of Bcl-2-GFP and Bcl-xL-GFP significantly reduced ONC212-mediated cell death. Furthermore, combining a sub-lethal dose of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor Navitoclax with ONC212 markedly augmented caspase-3 activation and cell death, still without any notable Delta Psi m loss or cytochrome c release. Moreover, inhibition of caspase-9 activity unexpectedly augmented, rather than attenuated, caspase-3 activation and the subsequent cell death. Collectively, our research identifies ONC212 as an atypical mitochondrial-independent, yet Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable, caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death inducer, highlighting its potential for combination therapies in tumors with defective mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.

AB  - BackgroundThe perivascular spaces of the brain are also known as Virchow-Robin spaces (VRSs). Dilated Virchow-Robin spaces in the brainstem are rare and mainly cause symptoms due to obstructive hydrocephalus, less frequently because of their size, mass effect, and impact on eloquent structures.Case illustrationWe present a patient with giant tumefactive VRS with hydrocephalus and neurological symptoms who was treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) followed by microscopic cyst fenestration. On the basis of this observation, we performed a thorough review of the literature to evaluate different treatment options.ResultsAn 11-year-old girl presented with a headache for 3 months. The patient had a giant tumefactive mesencephalothalamic VRS with triventricular hydrocephalus. She was initially treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy and multiple cyst fenestration. Symptomatic cyst regrowth required multiple cyst fenestrations via transcallosal transchoroidal (N = 2) and subtemporal approaches (N = 1) at the 2- and 4-year follow-ups. A literature review of these conditions allowed the detection of 12 cases (including our index case), and only 25% (3/12) of the patients underwent cyst fenestration 16.7% (2/12) required endoscopic fenestration and 8.3% (1/12) required microscopic fenestration.ConclusionGiant mesencephalothalamic dVRSs are rare in the pediatric population. These patients are usually symptomatic due to obstructive hydrocephalus. Surgical options are endoscopic third ventriculostomy, ventricular shunt procedures, or direct cyst fenestration (microscopic or endoscopic). Close follow-up is mandatory owing to the risk of progression of the disease. Cyst fenestration resolves symptoms immediately, as it addresses both hydrocephalus and mass effects due to the cystic lesion in the same setting.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic condition, characterized by hyperglycaemia, oxidative imbalance, pancreatic beta-cell death, and insulin insufficiency. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) can ameliorate inflammatory response and oxidative stress. However, like other small-molecule drugs, free ARBs show poor in vivo efficacy and dose-limiting toxicities. Hence, in this study, we developed nano-formulations of telmisartan (TEL), an ARB, by encapsulating it inside a murine insulinoma cell-derived extracellular vesicle (nanoTEL) and a bio-mimetic lipid nanovesicle (lipoTEL). Both nano-formulations showed spherical morphology and sustained release of TEL. In vitro, nanoTEL restored oxidative equilibrium, attenuated reactive oxygen species levels, enhanced the uptake of glucose analogue, and increased the expression of glucose transporter protein 4 better than lipoTEL. In a streptozotocin-induced murine model of diabetes, nanoTEL lowered blood glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and promoted insulin synthesis and secretion significantly better than lipoTEL. Moreover, nanoTEL was found superior in ameliorating the pancreatic inflammatory microenvironment by regulating NF-kappa Bp65, HIF-1 alpha, and PPAR-gamma expression; modulating IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-10, and IL-4 levels and inducing the polarization of macrophage from M1 to M2. Further, nanoTEL administration induced angiogenesis and promoted the proliferation of pancreatic cells to restore the structural integrity of the islets of Langerhans more efficiently than lipoTEL. These findings collectively suggest that nanoTEL outperforms lipoTEL in restoring the function of pancreatic beta-cells by modulating the pancreatic inflammatory microenvironment and show potential for the treatment of DM.

AB  - Background We sought to estimate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Methods Hospital records of children (6 months to 14 years) with tuberculous meningitis were retrospectively analyzed from September 2019 through January 2022. In September 2019, the first case of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity in tuberculous meningitis was identified in our division. Since then, all admitted children with tuberculous meningitis have been screened for paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity using the Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity Assessment Measure (PSH-AM). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is suspected when any of the following are present: recurrence of fever after initial defervescence, episodic posturing, dystonia, or unexplained tachycardia. Outcome at 3 months was prospectively scored according to the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score. Results Forty-one hospital records of children with tuberculous meningitis were analyzed, and 6 of them had paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 5/6; possible paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, 1/6). Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity appeared after a mean duration of 17 weeks (range: 12-25 weeks) from the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis in 4 of 6 children and at 4 weeks in 2 of 6 children. Children with tuberculous meningitis who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity were younger (median age: 5 years) compared with the nonparoxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity tuberculous meningitis cohort (median age: 10 years). A high proportion of children who developed paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity had hydrocephalus at presentation (5 of 6 [83.3%] vs 12 of 35 [34.3%], P = .035). Hospital stay was significantly prolonged in children with probable paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 71.2 +/- 26.8 days) compared with tuberculous meningitis without paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (mean: 20.8 +/- 11.6 days; P < .0001). Conclusion Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is a late complication of tuberculous meningitis observed in 14.6% cases and should be anticipated in children with reappearance of fever or neurologic worsening without any apparent cause.

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) have been used as adjuncts to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthrocentesis but without any high-quality evidence. This systematic review collated data from published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide level-1 evidence on its efficacy. Trials published on the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science up to 4 August 2023 and comparing intra-articular PRP/PRF with control after TMJ arthrocentesis were eligible. Primary outcomes were pain and maximal mouth opening (MMO). Twelve RCTs were included. Pooled analysis showed that pain scores were significantly reduced with the use of PRP/PRF as compared with control at one month (MD: -0.96 95% CI: -1.58 to -0.35 I-2 = 86%), three months (MD: -1.22 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.59 I-2 = 85%), and >= six months (MD: -1.61 95% CI: -2.22 to -1.00 I-2 = 88%). Similarly, MMO was significantly improved in the PRP/PRF group at one month (MD: 2.40 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.77 I-2 = 88%), three months (MD: 3.17 95% CI: 1.63 to 4.72 I-2 = 91%), and >= six months (MD: 2.98 95% CI: 1.86 to 4.10 I-2 = 75%) as compared with the control group. Subgroup analysis for PRP and PRF failed to show any difference in outcomes. Moderate quality evidence suggests that PRP and PRF may significantly improve pain and MMO when used as adjuncts to TMJ arthrocentesis. Due to the small effect size, the clinical significance of the results is questionable. The high heterogeneity in PRP/PRF preparation methods is a significant limitation.

AB  - Background In today's modern world, shift working has become an important part of society and industrial work; prolonged wakefulness is a widespread phenomenon due to which the sleep patterns of individuals are getting disturbed, and many sleep disorders are arising. Purpose This study compared the sleep quality and insomnia of the security guards working the day and night shifts. Methods This observational study comprised 100 security guards from Delhi and the NCR region. Self-administered questionnaires, i.e., the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), were used to assess sleep quality and insomnia. Fifty questionnaires were filled out by the day shift security guards, and the night shift security guards filled out 50. The data underwent analysis, and a comparison was conducted between security workers on night and day shifts using a Mann-Whitney U test, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results The result revealed a significant difference (95% CI; p < 0.05) for the variables, sleep quality and insomnia when compared between night and day shift working security guards. Among night shift workers, 74% reported issues with sleep quality and 48% experienced insomnia. In comparison, among day shift workers, 58% reported concerns about sleep quality, while 32% reported experiencing insomnia. Conclusion The study concluded that night-shift working security guards had poorer sleep quality and a higher prevalence of insomnia compared to their day-shift counterparts. These differences are highly significant, highlighting the potential adverse effects of night shift work on sleep health, urging the need for interventions to improve sleep quality and manage insomnia among night shift workers.

AB  - The rise of antimicrobial resistance has positioned ESKAPE pathogens as a serious global health threat, primarily due to the limitations and frequent failures of current treatment options. This growing risk has spurred the scientific community to seek innovative antibiotic therapies and improved oversight strategies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the origins and resistance mechanisms of ESKAPE pathogens, while also exploring next-generation treatment strategies for these infections. In addition, it will address both traditional and novel approaches to combating antibiotic resistance, offering insights into potential new therapeutic avenues. Emerging research underscores the urgency of developing new antimicrobial agents and strategies to overcome resistance, highlighting the need for novel drug classes and combination therapies. Advances in genomic technologies and a deeper understanding of microbial pathogenesis are crucial in identifying effective treatments. Integrating precision medicine and personalized approaches could enhance therapeutic efficacy. The review also emphasizes the importance of global collaboration in surveillance and stewardship, as well as policy reforms, enhanced diagnostic tools, and public awareness initiatives, to address resistance on a worldwide scale.

AB  - Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that impairs motor abilities. Identifying maternal biomarker derangements can facilitate further evaluation for early diagnosis, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between maternal biomarker derangements and CP development during the antenatal period. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, following MOOSE guidelines. Data on participants exceeding biomarker thresholds (95th and 5th percentiles) were extracted for combined odds ratio estimation. Geometric mean differences, reported as multiples of the median (MoMs), were used to analyze changes in marker levels. Trimesterwise subgroup analysis and metaregression assessed the impact of variables on outcomes. Results: Five observational studies (1552 cases, 484,985 controls) revealed lower maternal pregnancyassociated plasma protein A levels were associated with CP (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22 to 2.09; I = 0%), with a -0.04 MoM geometric mean difference. Lower maternal beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels in first and second trimesters indicated a pooled OR = 1.18 (95% CI = 0.85 to 1.63; I = 57%). Sensitivity analysis showed an OR =1.40 (95% CI =1.08 to 1.82; I = 0%), with a -0.07 MoM geometric mean difference. Metaregression identified primigravida status as negatively influencing beta-HCG levels. Elevated nuchal translucency values and CP presented a pooled OR = 1.06 (95% CI = 0.77 to 1.44; I = 0%). Conclusion: Lower maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels during the first trimester and lower beta-HCG levels in the first and second trimesters are associated with CP development in children. Future research should validate the predictive utility of these biomarkers and explore novel ones through large-scale cohort studies. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A disbalance between immune regulatory cells and inflammatory cells is known to drive atherosclerosis. However, the exact mechanism is not clear. Here, we investigated the homing of immune regulatory cells, mainly, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) subsets in asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor-exposed young individuals (dyslipidemia [DLP] group) and stable CAD patients (CAD group). Compared with healthy controls (HCs), Tregs frequency was reduced in both DLP and CAD groups but expressed high levels of CCR5 in both groups. The frequency of monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) was increased while polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) were decreased in CAD patients only. Interestingly, although unchanged in frequency, M-MDSCs of the DLP group expressed high levels of CCR5. Serum levels of chemokines (CCL5, CX3CL1, CCL26) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were higher in the DLP group. Stimulation with inflammatory cytokines augmented CCR5 expression in Tregs and M-MDSCs isolated from HCs. Activated endothelial cells showed elevated levels of CX3CL1 and CCL5 in vitro. Blocking CCR5 with D-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA) increased Treg and M-MDSC frequency in C57Bl6 mice fed a high-fat diet. In accelerated atherosclerosis model, DAPTA treatment led to the formation of smooth muscle-rich plaque with less macrophages. Thus, we show that CCR5-CCL5 axis is instrumental in recruiting Tregs and M-MDSCs to dysfunctional endothelium in the asymptomatic phase of atherosclerosis contributing to atherosclerosis progression. Drugs targeting CCR5 in asymptomatic and CAD risk-factor/s-exposed individuals might be a novel therapeutic regime to diminish atherogenesis.

AB  - Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by recurrent infections with Candida spp., often linked to primary immunodeficiencies. We report a case of two 8-year-old monozygotic twin brothers presenting with extensive dermatophytosis, later diagnosed with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) syndrome due to a homozygous p.M1V mutation in the AIRE gene. The twins exhibited widespread skin and nail infection, along with malabsorption, dental caries, and other autoimmune manifestations. This case highlights the novel presentation of extensive dermatophytosis in APECED, underscoring the variability in clinical expression even within a single family.

AB  - Introduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) warrants an early diagnosis and prompt management. Delay in diagnosis can result in repeated flares, permanent damage, and even death. There is a large variability in the time taken to diagnose SLE across the world. We undertook this study to determine the time taken for diagnosis of SLE in India and to identify the factors associated. Methods: Patients with SLE diagnosed within the previous 1 year as per Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics criteria (SLICC) 2012 criteria were included in a cross-sectional multicentre questionnaire-based survey. Demographic profile, self-reported socioeconomic status as per Kuppuswamy classification of socioeconomic status (version 2022) (SES), and several healthcare related parameters including referral pattern were recorded. Median time taken for diagnosis was used to demarcate early or late diagnosis and associated factors were explored. Results: We included 488 patients with SLE from 10 rheumatology centres. The median time to diagnosis was 6 months Interquartile Range (IQR 3,14.7) and within 3 months in about one third [150(30.7%)]. Very early diagnosis (<1 month) was established in 78(16.0%) patients. The mean SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) at diagnosis was 10.28+7.24. In univariate analysis, an older age, lower SES, non-southern state of residence and larger family size were significantly associated with late diagnosis. In the multivariate analysis, higher SES (AOR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98), multiple organ system involvement at initial presentation (AOR1.75 95%CI: 1.08-2.84) and place of residence in south Indian states (AOR1.92 95%CI: 1.24-2.97) had lesser odds of being associated with late diagnosis. Distance from the closest medical centre/professional did not influence the time to diagnosis. Majority of patients had first consulted a medical graduate (42.5%) or postgraduate doctor (48.2%), and referral to rheumatologist was largely done by postgraduate (65%) doctors. More than half of our patients (61%) self-finance their treatment. Conclusion: Median time to diagnosis of SLE was 6 months, 1/3rd being diagnosed within 3 months and 78(16.0%) with 1 month of symptom onset. Delay in diagnosis was noted in those belonging to lower socioeconomic strata and those with single organ disease. Distance to the health care facility did not influence time to diagnosis.

AB  - The progression of gallbladder inflammatory lesions to invasive cancer remains poorly understood, necessitating research on biomarkers involved in this transition. This study aims to identify and validate proteins associated with this progression, offering insights into potential diagnostic biomarkers for gallbladder cancer (GBC). Label-free liquid chromatography assisted tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics was performed on samples from 10 cases each of GBC and inflammatory lesions, with technical duplicates. Validation was conducted through the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using 80 samples (40 GBC and 40 inflammatory lesions). Bioinformatics tools analyzed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and pathways. Statistical correlations with clinicopathological variables were assessed. Prognostic evaluation utilized Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analyses. mRNA expressions were studied using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Out of 5,714 proteins analyzed, 621 were differentially expressed. Three upregulated (the S100 calcium-binding protein P [ S100P ] , polymeric immunoglobulin receptor [ PIGR ] , and complement C1q-binding protein [ C1QBP ] ) and two downregulated (transgelin [ TAGLN ] and calponin 1 [ CNN1 ] ) proteins showed significant expression. Pathway analysis implicated involvement of proteoglycans in cancer and glycosaminoglycan metabolism. Significant correlations were observed between protein concentrations and clinicopathological variables. Prognostic factors such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and preoperative bilirubin levels were associated with overall survival. Protein-based assays demonstrated higher resolution compared to mRNA analysis, suggesting their utility in GBC risk stratification. S100P, PIGR, C1QBP, TAGLN, and CNN1 emerge as potential protein-based biomarkers involved in the progression from gallbladder inflammatory lesions to invasive cancer. These findings hold promise for improved diagnostic and prognostic strategies in GBC management.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious health issue and is still one of the major causes of mortality around the globe. Natural products have progressively integrated into modern, advanced medical practices. Phytoconstituents from some medicinal plants have demonstrated therapeutic activity in treating different metabolic disorders and have been used to treat DM and its severe complications. The present review provides details of the major anti-diabetic targets identified in the literature and also provides comprehensive information regarding the therapeutic role of a synergy-based combination of phytoconstituents that functions by controlling specific molecular pathways synchronously by inhibiting certain key regulators involved in the development and progression of DM. The review also implicated the role of oxidative stress in diabetic complications and presented scientific validations of phytochemicals and their synergy-based combination using in vitro and or in vivo approaches.

AB  - Background: The burden of cancer in India has been rising, yet testing for early detection remains low. This study explored inequalities in the uptake of breast cancer (BC) examination and cervical cancer (CC) among Indian women, focusing on socioeconomic, regional, and educational differences. Methods: Data from the 2019-21 National Family Health Survey (n=353,518) were used to assess the uptake of BC examination and CC testing. Inequalities were quantified using the slope index of inequality (SII), relative index of inequality (RII), and relative concentration index (RCI). SII measured absolute inequality, while RII and RCI assessed relative inequality between disadvantaged and advantaged groups. Results: The ever uptake of tests for early detection of BC and CC were low at 9 and 20 per 1,000 women, respectively. Higher uptake was observed among women from the richest households compared to the poorest (SII: 1.1 for BC and 1.8 for CC). The magnitude of relative socioeconomic inequalities was more pronounced in rural areas (RCI: 22.5 for BC and 21.3 for CC) compared to urban areas. Similarly, higher-educated women were 4.84 times (RII: 4.84) and 2.12 times (RII: 2.12) more likely to undergo BC examination and CC testing, respectively, compared to noneducated women. The northeastern region exhibited greater socioeconomic inequality, while the western region showed more education-based inequality. Conclusion: The lower uptake of BC examination and CC testing and the marked inequalities underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve access and utilization of testing services, especially among lower-educated women, and those in rural areas.

AB  - <black square> INTRODUCTION: This study compares the effectiveness of virtual reality simulators (VRS) and a saw bone model for learning lumbar pedicle screw insertion (LPSI) in neurosurgery. <black square> METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional, randomized controlled laboratory investigation was conducted involving residents and fellows from a tertiary care referral hospital. Participants were divided into two groups (A and B). Group A performed 3 LPSI tasks: the first on a saw bone model, the second on VRS, and the third on another saw bone model. Group B completed 2 LPSI tasks: the first on a saw bone model and the second on another saw bone model. The accuracy of LPSI was evaluated through non- contrast computed tomography scans for the saw bone models, while the in-built application of VRS was utilized to check for accuracy of screw placement using the simulator. <black square> RESULTS: The study included 38 participants (19 in each group). Group A participants showed reduced mean entry point error (0.11 mm, P 0.024), increased mean purchase length (4.66 cm, P 0.007), and no cortical breaches (P P 0.031) when placing the second saw bone model screw. Similar improvements were observed among group A participants in PGY 1e3 while placing the second saw bone model screws. <black square> CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality simulators (VRS) prove to be an invaluable tool for teaching complex neurosurgical skills, such as LPSI, to trainees. This technology investment can enhance the learning curve while maintaining patient safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) tumors are challenging due to their unique anatomical location. This study aimed to evaluate the complexities in dealing with such precarious CVJ extradural lesions over the decade. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients of extradural CVJ tumors operated between 2009 and 2018 were included. The demographic details, neurological status, surgical approach, extent of resection, type of fixation, complications, and outcome at final follow-up were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 39.5 +/- 20 years. Most (17/27) of the patients had involvement of a single level. Clivus was the most common (9/17) involved region followed by atlas (7/17) vertebrae. Majority of the patients (13/27) were operated through the posterior- only approach. About 15 patients (55.5%) had instability or extensive lesions that necessitated posterior fixation. None of the patients underwent anterior fixation. Gross and near total excision were achieved in 10 patients (37%) and 3 patients (11%) respectively while 14 patients underwent subtotal excision of tumor. On histopathological analysis, clival chordoma (8/27) was found to be the most common pathology followed by giant cell tumor (6/27), plasmacytoma (4/27), and multiple myeloma (2/27). Most patients (13 out of 27) had the same neurological status after the surgery. Six patients (22%) improved post-operatively with decreased weakness and spasticity. Thirteen (48%) patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study provides valuable insights into managing extradural CVJ tumors and highlights the importance of individualized approaches for optimal outcome.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity in all age groups worldwide. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a salvage procedure in patients with TBI. The outcome and quality of life following DC is questionable. Basal cisternostomy (BC) has been proposed to reduce edema and lead to brain relaxation. It was initially used as an adjunct in TBI patients, thereby improving outcomes. With gaining popularity among neurosurgeons, BC was used as a standalone approach in TBI patients. This network meta-analysis aims to analyze the role of BC either as an adjunct or as a standalone approach in managing TBI patients. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) was performed using the search strategy using the field terms and medical subheading terms (MeSH Terms) to retrieve studies describing the role of BC in patients with TBI either as an adjunct with DC or standalone treatment and their outcome. Results: Thirty-one articles were selected for full-text review and 18 articles were selected for the final analysis. BC alone group was found to have minimum in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.348; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.254 to 0.477) followed by DC combined with BC group (OR, 0.645; 95% CrI, 0.476 to 0.875). DC combined with the BC group was found to have a minimum duration of mechanical ventilation (OR, 0.114; 95% CrI, 0.005 to 2.451) followed by the BC alone group (OR, 0.604; 95% CrI, 0.024 to 15.346). DC combined with the BC group were found to have the maximum Glasgow Outcome Scale score (OR, 1.661; 95% CrI, 0.907 to 3.041) followed by the BC alone group (OR, 1.553; 95% CrI, 0.907 to 3.041). Conclusions: Our analysis showed that BC alone was associated with lower in-hospital mortality rates in TBI patients. DC with BC had decreased the requirement of mechanical ventilation. However, larger multi-centric studies from other parts of the world are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background and objectives: The impact of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on quality of life (QOL) of children is not well established. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL, identify contributing factors, and determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression in children with CP in India.
   Methods: Children (8-18y old) with CP were prospectively enrolled across three pediatric gastroenterology centres in India. QOL was assessed using the pediatric QOL inventory (PedsQL 4.0) scale, administered to both children and their parents. Anxiety and depression was studied using the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 25). Contributing factors were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. The data was compared against published QOL data in healthy Indian children.
   Results: 121 children with CP (boys-57.9 %, age at QOL-14 +/- 3.2years) were enrolled. A majority (82.7 %) had pain and advanced disease (Cambridge grade IV- 63.6 %). Children with CP had poorer QOL compared to controls (total score 74.6 +/- 16 vs. 87.5 +/- 11.1, p < 0.0001). QOL scores were similar across centres. Older children were similar to younger ones, except for a poorer emotional QOL. Taking QOL < -2 standard deviation (SD) of controls, similar to 35 % had poor physical (50.9 +/- 11.9) and 20% had poor psychosocial (PS) QOL score (52.1 +/- 7.2). On analysis, presence of pain and lower socio-economic status (SES) adversely affected both physical and PS-QOL. Additionally, girls had poorer PS-QOL than boys (Odds ratio 3.1, 95%CI:1.23-7.31). Anxiety and depression were uncommon (2,1.6 %).
   Conclusions: Patients with CP had impaired physical and psycho-social QOL. Presence of pain and lower SES adversely affected QOL. Psychiatric comorbidities were uncommon. (c) 2024 IAP and EPC.

AB  - Background Lung cancer and tuberculosis share similar risk factors, clinical spectrum, radiological features and it is difficult to differentiate but it is important to diagnose both conditions for targeted therapy and better outcome. Aims Our primary objective was to estimate the proportion of TB in primary biopsy proven non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cases. Material & methods This prospective observational study was conducted in the Departments of Medicine/Pulmonary Medicine/Medical Oncology and Microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for a period of 2 years (January 2020-December 2021). Patients with biopsy proven, primary non-small cell lung cancer were recruited and sputum samples were subjected to microbiological investigations to confirm tuberculosis. Comparison was done in two groups of lung cancer patients with confirmed TB (Group A) and without confirmed tuberculosis (Group B). Results Total 75 patients with biopsy proven, primary NSCLC were recruited and 16 % (12/75) were diagnosed with confirmed TB. Adenocarcinoma (36.48 %) and Squamous cell carcinoma (33.44 %) were the two predominant histopathological subtypes of NSCLC. About 57 (76 %) of them were found to be in stage IV of Lung cancer at initial presentation itself (75 % in group A & 74.6 % in group B; p value < 0.80). A majority of patients (11/12 cases; 91 %) of group A were males with a mean age of 59 +/- 7.5 years. The upper lobes of the lung were involved in 65 % (49/75) of the cases and showing a mass lesion on imaging (75 % in group A & 65 % in group B; p value < 0.52). Kaplan Meier survival revealed a median survival time of 11 months in subjects with only NSCLC and a median survival time of 4 months in the group with concomitant TB and NSCLC (p value < 0.44).

AB  - Introduction: Knowledge of the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the population is an important risk management strategy for the prevention of this disease. This is especially true for India, which has resource-restrained settings with an increased risk in a younger population for the development of the disease. An important modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension, with its influence on the development of CVD. Methods: The data from the first wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) was used to calculate the 10-year CVD Risk Score among older adults >= 45 years using a WHO (2019) non-laboratory- based chart for South Asia. Univariate analysis was done using Pearson's chi-square test, and multivariable analysis using ordinal logistic regression. Categories of CVD risk score were considered as dependent variable. Socio-demographic variables, regular exercise, history of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia were considered as the independent variables. Relationship between CVD Risk score and hypertensives and self-reported hypertensives were presented using restricted cubic splines. Result: Two-thirds (68.8%) of the population had a 10-year CVD risk of <10, and 2.8% had a risk of >= 20%. The self-reported hypertensives were distributed linearly in restricted cubic splines, with a more scattered distribution in higher scores, while actual hypertensives showed a sigmoid pattern. Urban residents (OR-0.88), being unmarried (OR-0.86), being in the richer (OR-0.94) and richest (OR-0.86) monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) quintile and exercising regularly (OR-0.68) decreased the odds of being in a higher CVD risk score. Less than primary schooling (1.21) and diabetics (1.69) had higher odds for a higher CVD risk score. Conclusion: In this population, two-thirds had <10% risk for the development of CVD. The study shows a higher risk among rural, poor, and those with a lower education and lower CVD risk for those undertaking physical activity. The sigmoid pattern in actual hypertensives highlights the need for early detection. Even those with undiagnosed hypertension but with a higher BP had a similar risk for disease development, thus highlighting the need for an early detection of hypertension.

AB  - Aim. The present study sought to evaluate the cardiovascular morphology and associated anomalies in patients with interrupted aortic arch (IAA) on CT angiography. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review of our departmental database was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with IAA on CT angiography between January 2014 and September 2022. The demographic information, anatomic characteristics, and associated cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with IAA were assessed. The morphological types of IAA were described in accordance with Celoria-Patton classification. Results. IAA was seen in 49 patients (32 males and 17 females; mean age: 15.9 months). The most common type of IAA based on the site of interruption was type A seen in 27/49 (55.1%) patients, while type B was observed in 22/49 (44.9%) patients. No patient of type C IAA was encountered in the current series. The most commonly associated cardiovascular anomaly was patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) seen in 45/49 (91.8%) patients. Atrial septal defect was seen in 15/49 (30.6%) patients, while 39/49 (79.6%) patients had a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Common arterial trunk was the most common abnormal ventriculo-arterial connection seen in 13/49 (26.5%) patients. Aorto-pulmonary window was associated with 7/49 (14.3%) patients. Conclusion. IAA is a rare congenital heart defect associated with an array of cardiovascular anomalies, most common being PDA and VSD. CT angiography is useful not only in diagnosing and characterizing the IAA but also in identifying associated anomalies which may have a bearing on the clinical presentation, prognosis, and surgical management.

AB  - Background: Chest X-ray, the established standard of confirming endotracheal tube (ETT) position, has important drawbacks including radiation exposure. Point-of-care airway ultrasound, which has been insufficiently studied in children, can overcome these problems. Materials and methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study done on children aged 2 months to 17 years undergoing intubation with cuffed ETT in the PICU. The ETT cuff was filled with saline and three ultrasonographic techniques were used- 1) Suprasternal (SS) method 2) Cricoid (CC) metho and 3) Tracheal ring (TR) method. Position of the ETT as determined by ultrasound and X-ray were compared. The main outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) for ultrasound-based methods vs. X-ray. For the TR method, concordance between the X-ray and ultrasound categories were taken. Results: Total 62 patients were enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of SS method were 71% (95% CI: 57-83%) and 100% (40-100%). The CC distance method had an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.0). In the TR method, 98% of correct position on X-ray were correctly classified by USG. The agreement between X-ray and ultrasound categories with the cuff between the first and third tracheal rings, was very good [kappa (95% CI): 0.87 (0.70, 1.00), p <= 0.001)]. Conclusion: Bedside ultrasound is a good method to confirm ETT depth in children. The tracheal ring method had the best diagnostic accuracy and is easy to perform. The new method using cricoid cuff distance needs further validation in different ICU settings. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the pursuit of new wound care products, researchers are exploring methods to improve wound healing through exogenous wound healing products. However, diverging from this conventional approach, this work has developed an endogenous support system for wound healing, drawing inspiration from the body's innate healing mechanisms governed by the sequential release of metal ions by body at wound site to promote different stages of wound healing. This work engineers a multi-ion-releasing sprayable hydrogel system, to mimic this intricate process, representing the next evolutionary step in wound care products. It comprises Alginate (Alg) and Fibrin (Fib) hydrogel infused with Polylactic acid (PLA) polymeric microcarriers encapsulating multi (calcium, copper, and zinc) nanoparticles (Alg-Fib-PLA-nCMB). Developed sprayable Alg-Fib-PLA-nCMB hydrogel show sustained release of beneficial multi metallic ions at wound site, offering a range of advantages including enhanced cellular function, antibacterial properties, and promotion of crucial wound healing processes like cell migration, ROS mitigation, macrophage polarization, collagen deposition, and vascular regeneration. In a comparative study with a commercial product (Midstress spray), developed Alg-Fib-PLA-nCMB hydrogel demonstrates superior wound healing outcomes in a rat model, indicating its potential for next generation wound care product, addressing critical challenges and offering a promising avenue for future advancements in the wound management.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subpopulation of cancer cells that are believed to initiate and drive cancer progression. In animal models, xenotransplanted CSCs have demonstrated the ability to produce tumors. Since their initial isolation in blood cancers, CSCs have been identified in various solid human cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In addition to their tumorigenic properties, dysregulated stem-cell-related signaling pathways-Wnt family member (Wnt), neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (Notch), and hedgehog-have been shown to endow CSCs with characteristics like self-renewal, phenotypic plasticity, and chemoresistance, contributing to recurrence and treatment failure. Consequently, CSCs have become targets for new therapeutic agents, with some currently in different phases of clinical trials. Notably, small molecule inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway, such as vismodegib and glasdegib, have been approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. Other strategies for eradicating CSCs include natural compounds, nano-drug delivery systems, targeting mitochondria and the CSC microenvironment, autophagy, hyperthermia, and immunotherapy. Despite the extensive documentation of CSCs in OSCC since its first demonstration in head and neck (HN) SCC in 2007, none of these novel pharmacological approaches have yet entered clinical trials for OSCC patients. This narrative review summarizes the in vivo and in vitro evidence of CSCs and CSC-related signaling pathways in OSCC, highlighting their role in promoting chemoresistance and immunotherapy resistance. Additionally, it addresses methodological challenges and discusses future research directions to improve experimental systems and advance CSC studies.

AB  - Pr & eacute;cis: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess visual cortical activity in patients with primary open angle (POAG) and primary angle closure (PACG) glaucomas. There was decreased activity in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients correlating with the severity of glaucoma. Objective: To evaluate visual cortex activity using fNIRS in POAG and PACG compared with healthy controls. Methods: A total of 30 POAGs, 31 PACGs, and 30 healthy aged-matched controls from a single centre were recruited in this cross-sectional observational pilot study with purposive sampling. The POAG and PACG groups were age-matched but were not matched for disease severity at recruitment. All participants underwent fNIRS testing using a multichannel continuous-wave near-infrared system NIRSport 8x7 device (NIRx Medizintechnik GmbH). The visual cortex activity was evaluated in terms of the maximum amplitude of change in oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) concentration over 10 seconds, and a comparison was done among 3 groups. Both POAG and PACG groups were combined (termed as glaucoma group) to assess the relationship of visual cortical activity with disease severity (by visual field defect (mean deviation) and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness). Results: All participants showed the characteristic response of increased OxyHb and decreased deoxyhemoglobin during stimulus presentation. The maximum amplitude of change in OxyHb concentration over 10 seconds was significantly lower in both POAG and PACG groups compared with control in the right and left middle occipital gyri (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between PACG and POAG. Importantly, there was a negative correlation between the visual cortex activity with the visual field defects (mean deviation; P < 0.05) and a positive correlation with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in the glaucoma group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In patients with glaucoma, a reduction in visual cortical activity was observed, which may be indicative of neuronal degeneration occurring in the occipital cortex. Disease severity in glaucoma appears to be closely correlated with visual cortex activity. fNIRS can serve as a useful neuroimaging modality for assessing the hemodynamic and neurodegenerative changes in glaucoma.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes and surgical safety between femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS) in vitrectomized eyes. Methods: A prospective interventional comparative study was conducted at a tertiary eye care center. Sixty consecutive cases requiring cataract surgery following pars plana vitrectomy were allocated into Group 1 (n = 30), who underwent FLACS with intraocular lens implantation, and Group 2 (n = 30), who underwent CPCS with intraocular lens implantation, and followed up for 3 months. Primary outcome measures were intraoperative ultrasonic cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) and intraoperative and postoperative complications. The secondary outcome measures were postoperative changes in endothelial cell count (ECC) and central corneal thickness (CCT). Results: Baseline corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), ECC, and CCT were comparable. Intraoperative CDE was significantly less in the FLACS group (8.11 vs. 15.83 percentage seconds; P = 0.012) with no intraoperative complication in either group. The postoperative CDVA was comparable between the groups with a trend toward earlier visual recovery in the FLACS group. The postoperative day (POD) 1 endothelial cell loss was higher in the CPCS group (7.54% vs. 2.05%), with the mean endothelial cell density being significantly higher in the FLACS group throughout the follow-up period (P < 0.05). POD-1 corneal edema was higher in the CPCS group compared to FLACS with no significant difference on follow-up. Intraoperative migration of silicone oil to the anterior chamber was observed in 40% versus 0% in the CPCS versus FLACS groups, respectively. Conclusion: FLACS can be safely performed in post-vitrectomy eyes with lesser intraoperative ultrasonic energy used, postoperative endothelial cell loss, and change in CCT compared to CPCS.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Rising hypertension from inadequate detection, noncompliance with treatment, and poor control presents a major public health challenge. Previously, adopting the strategy of self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) showed better hypertension detection, control, and medication adherence. However, evidence from India is scarce. Here, we present the trial protocol for the effectiveness of SMBP intervention in hypertension detection, blood pressure (BP) control, and medication adherence in a primary care set-up.Methods:EASE-BP is an open-label randomized trial in two distinct adult populations - part-A self-reported non-hypertensive population (total sample size: 400) and part-B known hypertensive population (total sample size: 332). The two populations will be sampled from two separate villages under the Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System. In both the populations, participants randomized in the intervention arm will receive a validated electronic BP device and will be advised to self-monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more). Those in the control arm will be advised to monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more) at the nearby health center. Participants in both arms will receive education on hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. In addition, adult family members in the households of randomized participants will be encouraged to monitor their BP. All participants and family members will be instructed to maintain a log of BP recordings in a diary that will be provided to them. Data will be collected at baseline and then every month for three-months. The primary outcome in part-A will be the incidence of new cases of hypertension during 3 months follow-up and in part-B will be the difference in SBP and rate of medication adherence at 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include (1) uptake of the intervention, (2) any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, (3) additional yield of new cases of hypertension among the family members, and (4) integrating the intervention into the national programs for long-term noncommunicable disease goals.Conclusion:EASE-BP will help understand if SMBP improves hypertension detection, BP control, and medication adherence. Consequently, this will appraise policymakers on whether provision of BP instruments may be added to the national program for hypertension prevention and control.Trial Registry Number:This trial was registered under Clinical Trial Registry - India with reference number CTRI/2023/02/049949.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Rising hypertension from inadequate detection, noncompliance with treatment, and poor control presents a major public health challenge. Previously, adopting the strategy of self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) showed better hypertension detection, control, and medication adherence. However, evidence from India is scarce. Here, we present the trial protocol for the effectiveness of SMBP intervention in hypertension detection, blood pressure (BP) control, and medication adherence in a primary care set-up.Methods:EASE-BP is an open-label randomized trial in two distinct adult populations - part-A self-reported non-hypertensive population (total sample size: 400) and part-B known hypertensive population (total sample size: 332). The two populations will be sampled from two separate villages under the Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System. In both the populations, participants randomized in the intervention arm will receive a validated electronic BP device and will be advised to self-monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more). Those in the control arm will be advised to monitor BP for at least twice a month (or more) at the nearby health center. Participants in both arms will receive education on hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. In addition, adult family members in the households of randomized participants will be encouraged to monitor their BP. All participants and family members will be instructed to maintain a log of BP recordings in a diary that will be provided to them. Data will be collected at baseline and then every month for three-months. The primary outcome in part-A will be the incidence of new cases of hypertension during 3 months follow-up and in part-B will be the difference in SBP and rate of medication adherence at 3 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include (1) uptake of the intervention, (2) any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death, (3) additional yield of new cases of hypertension among the family members, and (4) integrating the intervention into the national programs for long-term noncommunicable disease goals.Conclusion:EASE-BP will help understand if SMBP improves hypertension detection, BP control, and medication adherence. Consequently, this will appraise policymakers on whether provision of BP instruments may be added to the national program for hypertension prevention and control.Trial Registry Number:This trial was registered under Clinical Trial Registry - India with reference number CTRI/2023/02/049949.

AB  - Background: Increasing rates of macrolide and fluroquinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) are being reported worldwide with resultant treatment failure. Aim: We aimed to determine the level of antibiotic resistance of MG in men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a sexually transmitted infections (STIs) clinic in New Delhi, India. Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting MgPa and pdhD genes were performed to detect MG rectal, urogenital or oropharyngeal infections in 180 MSM between January 2022 and June 2023. Macrolide resistance- associated mutations (MRM) and quinolone resistance-associated mutations (QRM) were detected by specific amplification of domain V of 23SrRNA gene and appropriate regions of p arC and gyrA genes respectively followed by sequencing. PCRbased screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection was also performed. Results: A total of 13 (7.2%) MSM were positive for MG infection. The most common site of infection was anorectum (8/13; 61.5%) followed by the urethra (5/13; 38.5%). None of the patients had infection at both the sites, and no oropharyngeal MG infection was detected. CT infection was detected in 37 (20.6%) MSM. Of the 13 MG-infected MSM, 6 (46.2%) were co-infected with CT. MRM and QRM were found in five (46.2%) and two (15.4%) strains, respectively. Both Quinolone resistance mutation (QRM)-harbouring strains also harboured MRM. All the five MG isolates carried the MRM A2071G. Both the QRM isolates co-harboured the parC and gyrA single-nucleotide polymorphisms. There was no correlation between the presence of antibiotic resistance and co-infection with CT (P = 0.52). Limitation: Because all patients in the study were MSM, the high rate of resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones could not be extrapolated for non-MSM patients. Conclusion: This is a report of an initial survey of antibiotic resistance to MG in a country where its diagnosis and treatment are not routinely available. We found a high prevalence of MG-carrying MRM, QRM and dual-class resistance in MSM in the absence of antibiotic exposure. This study mandates the need for both screening and detection of antimicrobial resistance against MG.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of bent ab interno needle goniectomy (BANG) in moderate to severe primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes undergoing phacoemulsification (phaco). Design: Single-arm, prospective, interventional study. Methods: POAG patients with medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP), >15 mmHg for moderate and >12 mmHg for severe POAG, with visually significant cataract were recruited. All patients underwent BANG using a 26-gauge needle to excise 30 degrees of the trabecular meshwork, along with phaco. Primary outcome was IOP. Secondary outcomes were success rate, percentage reduction in IOP/antiglaucoma medications (AGMs), and intraoperative complications. Success at 12 months was defined as: criterion A: IOP <15 mmHg for moderate glaucoma or <12 mmHg for severe glaucoma with or without AGMs OR criterion B: reduction in number of AGMs by >1. Results: Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients underwent BANG + phaco. Mean age of the participants was 62.7 +/- 8.4 years and there were 25 males and seven females. At 12 months, a significant decrease was noted in both IOP (from 17.6 +/- 3.6 to 12 +/- 1.6 mmHg, 31.8%; P < 0.001) and AGMs (from 3.7 +/- 0.9 to 2.8 +/- 0.8, 24.3%; P < 0.001). Twenty percent or more reduction in IOP was achieved in 62.5% (20/32) of eyes. Overall success (meeting either of the criteria A or B) at 12 months was achieved in 87.5% eyes. Mild postoperative hyphema was noted in 10 (31.2%) eyes, and two eyes (6.2%) required additional filtration surgery at 7 months. Conclusion: A 30-degree BANG with phaco in patients of POAG appears to be a safe, effective and affordable MIGS for developing countries.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective interventions designed by science which has helped in preventing millions of deaths, especially in children. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was established by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1974 to develop immunization programmes throughout the world with polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. The WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) has a disproportionately high burden of infectious diseases and has greatly benefitted from the EPI as compared to other regions with more than 90 per cent of the population having access to vaccines. The story of vaccines in South-East Asia is a testament to scientific progress, global collaboration, and unwavering commitment to public health. This article aims to discuss the journey of EPI in the WHO SEAR.

AB  - Background:The childhood central nervous system (CNS) acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) can be monophasic or recurrent, with both having considerable overlap in the first decade of life.Objectives:The objective of the study was to describe clinical and radiological features, immunological characteristics, response to therapy and difference between monophasic and first episode of recurrent disorders of pediatric-onset CNS ADS.Methods:Case records of all patients presenting with CNS ADS to the Department of Pediatrics between January 2009 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Those with complete records and at least 12 months follow up were included for analysis.Results:Overall 95 case records were reviewed (66 monophasic: 20 ADEM and 46 CIS, 29 recurrent: 18 MS, 9 NMOSD, and 2 multiphasic ADEM). The median age of the cohort was 7 years (range: 1-12) and nearly two-thirds (62/95) were males. All acute cases were treated with intravenous pulse followed by tapering oral steroid therapy. All the recurrent entities received azathioprine with rituximab in few. Certain clinical and radiological features of CIS and immune and inflammatory characteristics in CSF were found to be significantly different in monophasic cases compared to first episode of recurrent cases.Conclusions:The CNS ADS show favourable response to immunotherapy. Azathioprine may be an effective long term immunomodulator, particularly in resource limited settings. Certain clinical, radiological and immunological features may differentiate monophasic illness from first episode of recurrent disorder.

AB  - Pain is a common complaint among a spectrum of diseases. Although an ideal objective method of pain assessment is lacking, several validated tools are available for use in clinical research and practice. The tool considerations are based upon the parameters to be assessed and factors specific to patient, disease, and availability of instruments. This review classifies and brings the key aspects of currently available pain assessment tools on a single platform to ease the selection process for researchers/practitioners. The tools utilized for pain assessment were collected from articles available in PubMed and Google Scholar databases and classified into the following domains: unidimensional, multi-dimensional, investigation-based, and computerized algorithm-based tools. Their purpose of use and limitations are reviewed. The unidimensional scales are used to describe only the characteristics of pain, like intensity (e.g. numerical rating scale), type (e.g. neuropathic pain questionnaire), or pattern. In contrast, multi-dimensional tools, like Mc Gill Questionnaire, assess not only pain as an individual symptom but also its influence on physical functioning and general well-being. However, certain components like ethnicity, age, cognitive impairment, sedation, and emotion become a limiting factor in selecting the scale. In addition to these scales, a potential role of parameters such as biopotentials/markers has also been shown in pain assessment. Last, artificial intelligence is also being applied in evaluation of pain. Pain measurement is subjective in nature as assessed through questionnaires and observational tools. Currently, multi-dimensional approaches of pain assessment are available, which can lead to precision pain management.

The unidimensional scales are used to describe only the characteristics of pain, like intensity (e.g. numerical rating scale), type (e.g. neuropathic pain questionnaire), or pattern. In contrast, multi-dimensional tools, like Mc Gill Questionnaire, assess not only pain as an individual symptom but also its influence on physical functioning and general well-being. However, certain components like ethnicity, age, cognitive impairment, sedation, and emotion become a limiting factor in selecting the scale. In addition to these scales, a potential role of parameters such as biopotentials/markers has also been shown in pain assessment. Last, artificial intelligence is also being applied in evaluation of pain. Pain measurement is subjective in nature as assessed through questionnaires and observational tools. Currently, multi-dimensional approaches of pain assessment are available, which can lead to precision pain management.

AB  - Sepsis is a major contributor to poor child health outcomes around the world. The high morbidity, mortality, and societal cost associated with paediatric sepsis render it a global health priority, as summarised in Paper 1 of this Series. Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host response to infection that manifests as organ failure, and children are uniquely susceptible to sepsis, as discussed in Paper 2. The focus of this third Series paper is quality improvement in paediatric sepsis. The 2017 WHO resolution on sepsis outlined key aims to reduce the burden of sepsis. As of 2024, only a small number of countries have implemented systematic, paediatric-focused quality improvement programmes to raise sepsis awareness, enhance recognition of sepsis, promote timely treatment, and provide long-term support for paediatric sepsis survivors. We examine programme successes and systematic barriers to quality improvement targeting paediatric sepsis. We highlight the need for programme design to consider the entire patient journey, starting with prevention, caregiver awareness, recognition at home, education of the healthcare workforce, development of health-care systems, and establishment of long-term family and survivor support extending beyond the intensive care unit. Building on lessons learnt from existing quality improvement programmes, we outline implementation strategies and measures to enable benchmarking. Ultimately, quality improvement on a global scale can only be accelerated through a global learning platform focusing on paediatric sepsis.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Cervical flexion-induced myelopathy, also known as Hirayama disease (HD), is a lower motor neuron disorder seen mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting the C7-T1 myotomes, presenting as asymmetric weakness with wasting of one or both the distal upper limbs. We aimed to describe the clinical features, electrophysiology, and radiologic features of HD in a tertiary care institute in northern India.Methods:One hundred and forty patients between 2017 and 2022 with clinical and imaging features consistent with HD were retrospectively reviewed from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Comprehensive Neuromuscular Diseases center database.Results:Majority were males with the mean age of onset of illness being 17.8 years. The median duration of the symptoms was 3 (1.5-4) years. Sixty-nine (49%) patients had unilateral involvement, and the disease was actively progressing in 88 (63%) patients at presentation. Two families had history of HD in two (1.4%) siblings. Electromyography showed abnormal findings in the clinically involved limb in all the patients and in the clinically uninvolved limb in 17/50 (34%) patients. Flexion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated forward dural displacement in 134 (96%) patients and asymmetric cord flattening in 124 (88.5%) patients. Disability was graded as mild, moderate, and severe; 12 (13%) had severe disability. The majority were managed conservatively, and four underwent surgery for HD.Conclusion:A high index of suspicion of HD needs to be kept in a young male presenting with distal upper limb weakness and atrophy. Dynamic MRI of the cervical spine in young adults presenting with hand wasting is inevitable. This disease needs to be managed aggressively and early to prevent serious dysfunction and loss of productivity.

AB  - Background:Timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is challenging. We aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic performance of sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques for the prediction of neonatal sepsis.Methods:We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases using "neonate," "sepsis" and "machine learning" as search terms. We included studies that developed or validated an ML algorithm to predict neonatal sepsis. Those incorporating automated vital-sign data were excluded. Among 5008 records, 74 full-text articles were screened. Two reviewers extracted information as per the CHARMS (CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies) checklist. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guideline extension for diagnostic test accuracy reviews and used the PROBAST tool for risk of bias assessment. Primary outcome was a predictive performance of ML models in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. We generated a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics curve for pooled analysis.Results:Of 19 studies (15,984 participants) with 76 ML models, the random forest algorithm was the most employed. The candidate predictors per model ranged from 5 to 93; most included birth weight and gestation. None performed external validation. The risk of bias was high (18 studies). For the prediction of any sepsis (14 studies), pooled sensitivity was 0.87 (95% credible interval: 0.75-0.94) and specificity was 0.89 (95% credible interval: 0.77-0.95). Pooled area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.94 (95% credible interval: 0.92-0.96). All studies, except one, used data from high- or upper-middle-income countries. With unavailable probability thresholds, the performance could not be assessed with sufficient precision.Conclusions:ML techniques have good diagnostic accuracy for neonatal sepsis. The need for the development of context-specific models from high-burden countries is highlighted.

TI  - Serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Endostatin as an Adjunct to Clinical Decision Making in Managing Radiation-induced Changes Post Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Spetzler Martin Grade 3 Arteriovenous Malformations Patients: A Pilot Study

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation induced changes (RIC) are the most common complications observed post Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and may be observed within 6e 18 months post procedure. It has been observed that almost one-third of RICs are symptomatic and half of them are persistent. There is no way to predict which patients will develop these changes and to what extent. METHODS: This was a prospective analytical pilot study with the aim of understanding the role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin as predictive factors for clinically symptomatic RIC in intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of Spetzler Martin (SM) grade 3 being managed with primary GKRS. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were analyzed; 60% of them had a history of bleed. The median volume of AVM nidus was 4.36 mL. One-third of the patients had no imaging changes suggestive of RIC at 1 year follow-up and 2 of the patients had symptomatic RIC needing intervention. Before GKRS, the median values of serum concentration of endostatin and VEGF were 34.98 ng/mL and 168.37 pg/mL, respectively. The serum values of VEGF at 1 month post GKRS was much lower than the pre-GKRS values but not found to be predictive of RIC. No correlation could be observed with the levels of serum endostatin and RIC. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients may develop resistant edema and necrosis post GKRS for intracranial AVMs, which may warrant medical and surgical intervention. Serum biomarkers like VEGF and endostatin may vary in the post GKRS period and can be used to identify at-risk cases, however more studies are needed to decide on appropriate time of sampling and identify clinically relevant predictive factors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to compare the safety, efficacy, and visual outcomes of 80-microns LASIK versus 100-microns LASIK in managing myopia and myopic astigmatism. The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India. Methods: This was a prospective contralateral eye study that included patients with myopia and myopic astigmatism seeking refractive correction. The eligibility criteria included normal corneal topography, an epithelial thickness less than 60 microns, a calculated percentage tissue ablation (with 100-microns flap) less than 40%, a calculated residual stromal bed thickness (with 100-microns flap) more than 300 microns, and willingness to participate and follow up. Patients with glaucoma, cataracts, other visually disabling ocular pathologies, and a history of past ocular surgery were excluded. All patients underwent LASIK with 80-microns LASIK in one eye and 100-microns LASIK in the other eye. The patients were followed up for 6 months, and the results were analyzed. Results: The study included 216 eyes of 108 patients. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent in the 80-microns group and the 100-microns group was -3.53 +/- 1.81 and -3.69 +/- 1.32 diopters, respectively (P = 0.78). The mean 6 months decimal postoperative UCVA was 0.98 +/- 0.13 in the 80-microns group and 0.97 +/- 0.14 in the 100-microns group (P = 0.99). The postoperative change in the higher-order aberration profile was comparable in both groups (P = 0.78). The percentage tissue ablation was significantly lower in the 80-microns group (P = 0.002). The incidence of flap micro striae and OBL was higher in the 80-microns group, while neither of these had any visual implications. Conclusion: The study concluded that 80-microns LASIK is an efficacious and safe alternative to 100-micron LASIK, especially useful in patients with higher myopia.

AB  - Objectives Fatty atrophy and fatty infiltration have been considered as limiting factors for rotator cuff repair. The metabolic activity of the muscle can be measured noninvasively by PET. In our study, we aim to compare the metabolic activity between the shoulders with rotator cuff tears and normal shoulders. Methods All the patients with unilateral full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. The patients were divided into two groups based on fatty atrophy and the metabolic activities of the rotator cuff muscles, trapezius, and deltoid were calculated using an F-18-2-deoxy-d-glucose PET-computed tomography scan for comparison. Results A total of 17 patients were included. The standardized uptake values were compared between the affected shoulder and the normal shoulders. There was a significant increase in uptake in the insertion sites and musculotendinous junctions in the rotator cuff torn group. The standardized uptake values showed no significant difference between the low-grade and high-grade groups. Conclusion Our first hypothesis was also proven wrong; when we found that there was no statistically significant difference in the metabolic activity in muscle bellies of normal shoulders and those with rotator cuff tears. Our second hypothesis was proven wrong when found that there was no statistically significant difference in the metabolic activities of rotator cuff muscles between high-grade and low-grade fatty atrophy groups. The metabolic activities of the middle deltoid and trapezius are inversely related. Based on the findings of our study, fatty atrophy or fatty infiltration alone cannot be considered a limiting factor for rotator cuff repair.

AB  - Introduction: The molecular basis and mechanisms of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (JNA) pathogenesis are still unknown. Despite being a rare and benign neoplasm, JNA is a locally aggressive and potentially destructive head and neck neoplasm, typically found in young males. The advancement of genome technologies and analytical tools has provided an un-paralleled opportunity to explore the intricacy of JNA. The present study provides the first evidence of the involvement of Y- chromosome genes in JNA. Methods: A total of 13 JNA patients at an advanced disease stage and five age-matched male controls were registered for this study. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis was conducted followed by functional analysis to understand the molecular mechanism of the JNA. Results: WES analysis revealed a high prevalence of mutations in 14 genes within the protein-coding, male-specific region of the Y- chromosome of young males (mean age: 13.8 +/- 2.4) with JNA. These mutations, occurring at 28 distinct positions, were char-acterized as moderate to high impact and were prevalent in nine JNA patients but not in the control group. The most frequently mutated genes were USP9Y and UTY, followed by KDM5D, DDX3Y, and TSPY4. The expression of USP9Y, UTY, and DDX3Y was found to be co-modulated, implying their coordinated regulation as a complex. Furthermore, somatic mutations were detected in genes previously linked to JNA. Conclusion: The wide array of genetic mutations in the Y-chromosome male-specific region, along with the somatic alterations identified in JNA, provides novel insights into JNA pathophysiology.

AB  - Immune-mediated epilepsy (IME) constitutes a substantial proportion of drug-refractory epilepsies. Rapid diagnosis and prompt immunosuppression are required along with antiseizure medications (ASMs). Here we report three unrelated children who presented with fever, encephalopathy, and refractory epilepsy and subsequently tested positive for rare intraneuronal and surface receptor antibodies, namely, contactin-associated protein like 2 (CASPR2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), and paraneoplastic antigen Ma2 (PNMA2). In all of them, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was noncontributory. Electroencephalography showed nonspecific interictal epileptic discharges. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) brain scan revealed abnormality in metabolic pattern with hypermetabolism in basal ganglia, thalami, frontotemporal cortices, and cerebellar hemispheres, consistent with autoimmune encephalitis. Immunosuppression was initiated along with ASMs. Complete seizure freedom was achieved in GAD65 antibody IME and >50% seizure reduction in CASPR2 and PNMA2 antibody IME. A variable degree of behavioral problems persisted in all. Early immunosuppression is warranted in IME, but does not universally guarantee a complete response.

AB  - Background & Aims: : Since the onset of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been significant opportunity to leverage virtual platforms for communication and dissemination of knowledge. An online survey was conducted to examine the viewpoints of World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) leaders concerning the necessity, primary priority areas, and implementation strategies for a virtual global gastroenterology educational program. Methods: : We conducted a survey of leaders of WGO member societies to assess their opinions on creating opportunities for global education using virtual platforms, identifying practical implementation steps and priority educational areas. Results: : Responses were obtained from 57/117 (48.7%) contacted leaders with 56/57 (98.2%) identifying such a need. Five mutually exclusive priority educational topics were proposed in the survey: clinical gastroenterology, endoscopy, nutritional support, research methodology, and professional development. Overall, most participants prioritized clinical gastroenterology (45/57; 78.9%) and endoscopy/hand skills (27/57; 47.3%) as educational topics to be addressed by the virtual global gastroenterology educational program. A majority of WGO member society leaders surveyed favored monthly teaching activities (33/57; 57.8%), ideally carried out between 1500-2100 local time (31/57; 54.3%), ideally with no administrative fees (47/57; 82.4%). Conclusions: : This truly global survey of WGO member societies achieved a good response rate and provides important insights into the need for and scope of future virtual education programs under the aegis of the WGO.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Candidaemia is a potentially life-threatening emergency in the intensive care units (ICUs). Surveillance using common protocols in a large network of hospitals would give meaningful estimates of the burden of candidaemia and central line associated candidaemia in low resource settings. We undertook this study to understand the burden and epidemiology of candidaemia in multiple ICUs of India, leveraging the previously established healthcare-associated infections (HAI) surveillance network. Our aim was also to assess the impact that the pandemic of COVID-19 had on the rates and associated mortality of candidaemia. Methods: This study included adult patients from 67 Indian ICUs in the AIIMS-HAI surveillance network that conducted BSI surveillance in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICUs during and before the COVID-19 pandemic periods. Hospitals identified healthcare-associated candidaemia and central line associated candidaemia and reported clinical and microbiological data to the network as per established and previously published protocols. Results: A total of 401,601 patient days and 126,051 central line days were reported during the study period. A total of 377 events of candidaemia were recorded. The overall rate of candidaemia in our network was 0.93/1000 patient days. The rate of candidaemia in COVID-19 ICUs (2.52/1000 patient days) was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 ICUs (1.05/patient days) during the pandemic period. The rate of central line associated candidaemia in COVID-19 ICUs (4.53/1000 central line days) was also significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 ICUs (1.73/1000 central line days) during the pandemic period. Mortality in COVID-19 ICUs associated with candidaemia (61%) was higher than that in non-COVID-19 ICUs (41%). A total of 435 Candida spp. were isolated. C. tropicalis (26.7%) was the most common species. C. auris accounted for 17.5% of all isolates and had a high mortality. Conclusion: Patients in ICUs with COVID-19 infections have a much higher risk of candidaemia, CLAC and its associated mortality. Network level data helps in understanding the true burden of candidaemia and will help in framing infection control policies for the country.

AB  - Introduction: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting men globally, with a significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). With the recent therapeutic advancements and improvements in survival, there is a need to understand the determinants of HRQOL in metastatic prostate cancer patients to optimize treatment strategies for quality of life as the number of survivors increases. The aim of this study was to identify clinical variables that affect HRQOL and its domains in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at a tertiary cancer center in India. Baseline clinical features, treatment details, and completed Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), composed of FACT-general (FACT-G) and prostate cancer-specific concerns subscale (PCS) and FACT-P Trial Outcome Index (FACT-P TOI) questionnaires, were collected. The mean total, as well as individual domain scores, were calculated. Additionally, these were stratified by the current treatment being received by patients. Linear regression was used to identify independent factors affecting HRQOL in these patients. Results: Of the 106 enrolled patients, 84 completed the FACT-P questionnaire and were included in the analysis. The median age was 66 years, and at the time of assessment, 3 patients (3.6%) were receiving androgen deprivation therapy only, 53 patients (63.1%) were on ADT + androgen receptor-targeted agents (ARTAs), and 18 patients (21.4%) patients received ADT + chemotherapy. The mean (+/- standard deviation) of the FACT-P TOI score was 70.33 (+/- 15.16); the PCS subscale was the most affected, followed by functional well-being. Patients on chemotherapy scored significantly higher on PCS, but the composite scores were not significantly different. Univariable regression identified obesity (body mass index > 25 kg/m(2)) and duration of first-line treatment as significant predictors of better HRQOL; however, obesity was the only independent predictor in multivariable analysis (beta = 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 15.0; p = 0.022). Obesity also independently predicted a better FACT-P and its physical well-being domain score and PCS. Conclusion: Prostate cancer patients experience impaired QoL, especially in the prostate cancer-specific and functional well-being domains. Lower BMI is an independent predictor of poor QoL, and this requires efforts to assess the impact of strategies to manage the nutritional status of patients with metastatic disease on QoL outcomes.

AB  - Background:Previous studies have localized the origin of "generalized" spike-wave discharges of idiopathic generalized epilepsies to specific brain regions. Although there are studies in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) which have investigated the origin of spike-wave discharges, reports on the propagation of discharges are sparse.Objective:The current study investigated the propagation of spike-wave discharges in JME, which was investigated by statistically comparing the electroencephalography (EEG)-derived cortical source activity during (a) various phases of spike-wave discharge versus background (eyes closed) activity, and (b) various phases of the first spike wave versus the corresponding phase of subsequent spike waves.Material and Methods:Fourteen patients with JME who had generalized spike/polyspike and slow wave discharges in interictal EEG were included in the study. A total of 179 spike waves (first discernible spike wave - 55; subsequent spike waves - 124) were selected for source localization. Source analysis was carried out using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Statistical analyses to estimate the probability distribution of differences in cortical activity between (a) eight phases of epileptic discharge versus background (eyes closed) activity and (b) phases of the first spike wave versus the corresponding phases of subsequent spike waves were performed by paired t-tests and corrected for multiple testing using LORETA-KEY software.Results:Widespread activation of cortical voxels (more than 94%) was observed during all phases of epileptic discharge except the initial phase (pre-first spike) and terminal phase (post-peak of the subsequent wave). The parietal lobe, which was the most activated lobe during the pre-first spike, was found to be the least activated during the post-peak of first and subsequent waves. More than 93% of voxels in the sublobar region were consistently activated during all eight phases of discharge.Conclusion:The study findings suggest that the activity generated from the restricted brain network involving parietal lobe could be propagated through sublobar structures to cause widespread cortical activation during the subsequent phases of the spike-wave cycle.

AB  - Background Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis (TB) are the two most common causes of granulomatous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. These often exhibit overlapping clinical and radiological characteristics, rendering accurate diagnosis difficult. MicroRNA (miRNA) analysis is increasingly utilised as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a noninvasive technique for biomarker evaluation in different respiratory conditions. We attempted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in the EBC of sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB patients. Methods EBC was obtained from subjects with a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB. EBC was also obtained from age- and sex-matched control subjects. From EBC, miRNA isolation, cDNA preparation and qPCR array were performed. Differentially expressed miRNAs were shortlisted. Further validation was conducted in the EBC of a new subset. Results Subjects with a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis (50) and TB (50), and control subjects (50) were included. qPCR array from EBC (20 subjects from each group) shortlisted eight differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-126, miR-132, miR-139-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-181c, miR-454, miR-512-3p and miR-362-5p). In the validation set (EBC of 30 subjects from each group), miR-126 and miR-132 were differentially expressed significantly. The miR-126 and miR-132 expression ratio could differentiate sarcoidosis from mediastinal TB with an AUC of 0.618 (82% specificity and 41% sensitivity). Conclusion While EBC miRNA expression is significantly and differently altered in sarcoidosis and mediastinal TB, a simple ratiometric approach failed to provide clinically useful signatures for differentiating between the two in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

AB  - This case report presents an atypical manifestation of tuberculosis in a 21-year-old male who presented with multiple subcutaneous swellings in the bilateral heel, left elbow, and base of the left third finger for the previous 6 months. The patient also experienced loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. Despite initial suspicion of bacterial abscesses, antibiotics did not lead to significant improvement. Further investigations revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and findings suggestive of osteomyelitis on imaging. Gene Xpert testing confirmed multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative agent. The patient was prescribed a bedaquiline-based multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen, which resulted in reduction in swelling size. This report highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing complex cases of primary multiple tubercular abscesses, especially with drug-resistant strains, emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management for successful outcomes.

AB  - Plant microRNAs (miRNA) are regularly consumed orally along with diet, gaining attention for their RNA-based drug potential because of their ability to regulate mammalian gene expression specifically at the post-transcriptional level. Medicinally valued plants are well known for their anti-inflammatory property; however, the contribution of their miRNA in managing inflammation has been less studied. We investigated miRNA from four medicinally valued regularly consumed spices, and validated one of the most potential miRNA 'Clo-miR-14' for its thermal stability, and absorption in the plasma samples of RA patient's by RT-PCR. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the effect of Clo-miR-14 in ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) like symptoms. Our results suggest that 'Clo-miR-14,' an exogenous miRNA present in Curcuma longa, absorbed through regular diet, has robust thermal stability at 100degree celsius in humans. It significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 beta, IL-6) and RA-like symptoms, suggesting that plant-based miRNA could be a promising candidate as an RNA-based drug for RA pathogenesis.

TI  - INVESTIGATION OF BIOACTIVE FLAVONOID SOURCED FROM CITRUS FRUITS ON ITS EFFECT UPON CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives:Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive process of the heart. It is a leading cause for heart failure, which in turn has a high mortality rate. Hesperidin (HES) is a bioactive flavanone glycoside with agonistic activity on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), reported to be an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy signalling pathways. Therefore, we investigated the cardio-protective effect of this bioactive flavonoid in isoproterenol induced cardiac hypertrophy.Methods:The work was started after getting approval from the institutional animal ethics committee (IAEC). Male albino Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n=6) and administered isoproterenol (3 mg/kg/day s.c.) or hesperidin (200 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and isoproterenol or enalapril (30 mg/kg/day p.o.) and isoproterenol or a combination of hesperidin and enalapril for 28 days. On the 29 th day, rats were anaesthetized followed by cannulation of coronary artery to record hemodynamic parameters. Blood sample was collected and heart was excised to evaluate for parameters like biochemical, histopathological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies.Results:Hesperidin significantly normalized heart weight/body weight ratio and cardiomyocyte area in the treated rats. Moreover, hesperidin improved cardiac function and attenuated pathological changes as seen in the heart tissue sections. A decline in the levels of cardiac injury markers (CK-MB, LDH) and inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-6) was observed.Additionally, hesperidin suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis along with an increased PPAR-gamma expression.Conclusion:Hesperidin has a good potential for attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and acts by virtue of its PPAR-gamma agonistic, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties.

AB  - Male infertility is an emerging health problem and there is an urgent need to search for therapeutic options. Altered metabolic states such as obesity and metabolic syndrome have been linked with male infertility. Therefore, searching for metabolic biomarkers is vital. Present work aimed to study metabolic alterations in infertile males. The seminal levels of L-Carnitine (LC), Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and Ghrelin (GHRL) were evaluated in 14 infertile and 10 fertile males. Baseline semen analysis was performed for both cases and controls. The levels of LC and Kiss1 were found to be lower in infertile patients as compared to fertile controls and the difference was found to be statistically significant. There was no significant difference observed in GHRL levels between patients and controls. The study presents a preliminary data where LC and Kiss1 levels could possibly studied further for their association with male infertility. But to confirm their association with pathogenesis of male infertility, future studies need to be conducted in larger cohorts.

AB  - We describe and assess the efficiency of a novel technique of placing implantable collamer lens (ICL) footplates in the sulcus in poorly dilated pupils utilizing perioptic holes and two instruments simultaneously (Sinskey hook and ICL manipulator). Twelve eyes of 10 patients underwent ICL implantation through this technique. The technique employs a bimanual approach engaging perioptic holes in the eyes with intraoperative miosis. Perioptic holes were engaged with a Sinskey hook and pulled slightly back, while the footplates were tucked under the iris by using an ICL manipulator. All patients had uneventful surgery. At 1 week follow-up, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA) was -0.01 +/- 0.04 logMAR with a mean vault of 606.17 +/- 108.33 microns. No complications were noted. However, too small a pupil is a limiting factor; this technique can be of use in up to mid-dilated pupils. Bimanual placement of haptics of ICL may represent a safe and effective technique in insufficient mydriasis or intraoperative pupillary miosis.

AB  - Background and Objectives:Functional dissociative seizures (FDS) are very common in neurology clinics, they straddle both neurology and psychiatry. In India, scarce resources and guidelines are available for effectively conveying their diagnosis and management, which leads to a substantial gap in care. We aimed to provide an instructional module for FDS, tailored to clinicians, patients, and caregivers in Hindi, to enhance communication of diagnosis and facilitate suitable management strategies.Methods:The instructional module development process was based on clinical settings and expert opinions. A standard translation process was performed to ensure the linguistic and cultural equivalence. Validation was carried out by a panel of 15 validators, comprising 13 neurologists and two psychiatrists, to identify key psychoeducation components and their significance. They were provided a questionnaire consisting of five questions that were related to completeness, understandability, legibility, clarification, and usefulness of educational material for clinicians, patients, and caregivers. Items were rated using a 5-point Likert scale.Results:There was agreement on four items (Q1, Q3, Q4, and Q5), whereas approximately 85% of the validators agreed on the remaining one item (Q2). The instructional module demonstrated high content validity as indicated by both item level-content validity index (0.98) and scale-level content validity index (0.97), alongside content validity ratio and modified kappa statistics.Conclusions:The developed Hindi instructional module for FDS serves as a valuable tool to enhance the communication of FDS diagnosis and dispel misconceptions. This offers a comprehensive resource for clinicians, patients, and caregivers in India, potentially bridging gap in FDS care.

AB  - Purpose:As per the recent World Health Organization estimates, approximately 2.2 billion people have near and distance vision impairment (VI) globally, and out of this almost 50% is avoidable.Methods:The Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Visual Impairment survey was a cross-sectional study conducted in September 2021, using cluster random sampling in 42 clusters with a cluster size of 140, giving a total of 6000 participants. Two teams comprising of trained optometrists and social workers conducted the ocular examination which included unaided, pinhole, and aided visual acuity assessments followed by examination of the anterior segment and lens. Distance visual acuity was measured using simplified tumbling "E" charts of different sizes for VA of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. The lens assessment was done in an un-dilated pupil with torch light by the optometrist.Results:Overall, 6520 individuals aged 6 years and above were enumerated, of whom 5440 (83.4%) were examined. The response rate for examination was better among females (93.1%) than males (73.9%), and it decreased from 93.8% in the age group 6-15 years to 77.1% in the 45+ age group. The prevalence of blindness and VI were 0.18% (95% CI: 0.06-0.29) and 4.19% (95%CI: 3.65-4.72), respectively. The major causes of VI in all age groups were uncorrected refractive error (65.4%), cataract (23.7%), cataract surgical complications (2.6%), corneal opacity (0.4%), and other posterior segment diseases (7.5%). The effective cataract surgical coverage (eCSC) was 61.8%, effective refractive error coverage (eREC) for distance vision was 59.8%, and eREC for near vision was 47.0%.Conclusion:The RAAVI methodology is suitable to measure effective coverage in the general population, both for baseline measurement and periodic monitoring. The 2030 targets for the surveyed district are 90% eCSC and 100% eREC. Such exercises need to be conducted in each district of the country to determine the baseline and target values of effective coverage.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate in children with ataxia telangiectasia (ATTeST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial

AB  - Background Ataxia telangiectasia is a multisystem disorder with progressive neurodegeneration. Corticosteroids can improve neurological functioning in patients with the disorder but adrenal suppression and symptom recurrence on treatment discontinuation has limited their use, prompting the development of novel steroid delivery systems. The aim of the ATTeST study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-erythrocyte delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate compared with placebo in children with ataxia telangiectasia. Methods This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 22 centres in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Tunisia, the UK, and the USA). Eligible participants were children aged 6 years or older weighing more than 15 kg who met clinical criteria for ataxia telangiectasia but who had preserved autonomous gait. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to low-dose (approximately 5-10 mg), or high-dose (approximately 14-22 mg) intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate, or placebo, using an independent interactive web response system, with minimisation for sex and age (6-9 years vs >= 10 years). Intravenous intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate was administered once a month for 6 months. Participants, employees of the sponsor, investigators, all raters of efficacy endpoints, and central reviewers were masked to treatment assignment and dose allocations. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the modified International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (mICARS) from baseline to month 6, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials. gov (NCT02770807) and is complete. Findings Between March 2, 2017, and May 13, 2021, 239 children were assessed for eligibility, of whom 176 were randomly assigned. One patient assigned to high-dose intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate did not initiate treatment. 175 patients received at least one dose of treatment (59 patients received the low dose and 57 received the high dose of intra-erythrocyte dexamethasone sodium phosphate, and 59 received placebo). The mITT population comprised 164 participants (56 children in the low-dose group, 54 children in the high-dose group, and 54 in the placebo group). Compared with the placebo group, no differences were identified with regard to change in mICARS score from baseline to 6 months in the low-dose group (least squares mean difference -1<middle dot>37 [95% CI -2<middle dot>932 to 0<middle dot>190]) or the high-dose group (-1<middle dot>40 [-2<middle dot>957 to 0<middle dot>152]; p=0<middle dot>0765). Adverse events were reported in 43 (73%) of 59 participants in the low-dose group, 47 (82%) of 57 participants in the high-dose group, and 43 (73%) of 59 participants in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were observed in six (10%) of 59 participants in the low- dose group, seven (12%) of 57 participants in the high-dose group, and seven (12%) of 59 participants in the placebo group. There were no reports of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hirsutism, or Cushingoid appearance in any of the treatment groups, nor any treatment-related deaths.
   Interpretation Although there were no safety concerns, the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, possibly related to delays in treatment reducing the number of participants who received treatment as outlined in the protocol, and potentially different treatment effects according to age. Studies of intra-erythrocyte delivery of dexamethasone sodium phosphate will continue in participants aged 6-9 years, on the basis of findings from subgroup analyses from this trial.

AB  - Purpose To describe the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the Asia Cornea Society Infectious Keratitis Study (ACSIKS). Methods All bacterial isolates from ACSIKS underwent repeat microbiological identification in a central repository in Singapore. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was conducted for isolates of P. aeruginosa against thirteen antibiotics from 6 different classes, and categorized based on Clinical Laboratory Standard Institutes' reference ranges. The percentage rates of resistance (non-susceptibility) to each antibiotic included isolates of both intermediate and complete resistance. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes. Results Of the 1493 unique bacterial specimens obtained from ACSIKS, 319 isolates were of P. aeruginosa. The majority of isolates were from centers in India (n = 118, 37%), Singapore (n = 90, 28.2%), Hong Kong (n = 31, 9.7%) and Thailand (n = 30, 9.4%). The cumulative antibiotic resistance rate was the greatest for polymyxin B (100%), ciprofloxacin (17.6%) and moxifloxacin (16.9%), and lowest for cefepime (11.6%) and amikacin (13.5%). Isolates from India demonstrated the highest antibiotic resistance rates of all the centers, and included moxifloxacin (47.5%) and ciprofloxacin (39.8%). Forty-eight of the 59 MDR isolates also originated from India. Antibiotic resistance rates were significantly lower in the other ACSIKS centers, and were typically less than 10%. Conclusions The antibiotic resistance profiles of P. aeruginosa varied between different countries. While it was low for most countries, substantial antibiotic resistance and a significant number of multi-drug resistant isolates were noted in the centers from India.

AB  - Background: The Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dosage (LEDD) calculation algorithms help in capturing and harmonization of Parkinson's Disease (PD) therapies. Analyzing these updates is essential for validating their effectiveness. Objective: To assess updated LEDD conversion factors in capturing the newer therapies in PD and therapy modules in different geographical cohorts. Methods: Data were sourced from 10 Centers from 6 countries representing 2 different continents. The study compared the LEDD conversion factors proposed by Tomlinson et al and Jost et al, alongside investigating demographic disparities. Results: The analysis involved 2943 subjects; 87% (n = 2577) met the UK Brain Bank criteria for PD. The LEDD differed significantly across methodologies (Tomlinson vs. Jost, 598 mg vs 610 mg, P < 0.0001). Geographical disparities highlighted variations in PD onset age (P < 0.0001). Jost and Tomlinson's calculations demonstrated consistency within but significant differences across countries (P < 0.0001).Age at onset revealed statistically significant differences in LEDD requirements (P < 0.0001), which were particularly higher in 21-50 years (718 mg vs 566 mg). This subgroup also demonstrated increased usage of non-Levodopa therapies (P < 0.0001). Men exhibited higher total LEDD (P = 0.001). 34% reported dyskinesia, associated with higher LEDD (756 mg, P < 0.0001). Surgically treated patients also had higher LEDD (P < 0.0001) and a significant difference between Jost and Tomlinson dosages (761 mg vs716mg) reflecting the incorporation of newer therapeutic molecules. Conclusion: This analysis delineates the importance of updated LEDD algorithms and intricacies in the landscape of PD treatment, underscored by geographical, age-related, and gender-specific variations, in real-life management scenarios.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered an ongoing global pandemic, necessitating rapid and accurate diagnostic tools to monitor emerging variants and preparedness for the next outbreak. This study introduces a multidisciplinary approach combining Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and Machine learning to comprehensively characterize and strain-type SARS-CoV-2 variants. FTIR analysis of pharyngeal swabs from different pandemic waves revealed distinct vibrational profiles, particularly in nucleic acid and protein vibrations. The spectral wavenumber range between 1150 and 1240 cm(-1) was identified as the classification marker, distinguishing Healthy (noninfected) and infected samples. Machine learning algorithms, with neural networks exhibiting superior performance, successfully classified SARS-CoV-2 variants with a remarkable accuracy of 98.6%. Neural networks were also able to identify and differentiate a small cohort infected with influenza A variants, H1N1 and H3N2, from SARS-CoV-2-infected and Healthy samples. FTIR measurements further show distinct red shifts in vibrational energy and secondary structural alterations in the spike proteins of more transmissible forms of SARS-CoV-2 variants, providing experimental validation of the computational data. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for rapid and reliable SARS-CoV-2 variant identification, enhancing our understanding of viral evolution and aiding in diagnostic advancements, particularly for an infectious disease with unknown etiology.

AB  - <bold>Introduction</bold> Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the deadliest infectious diseases over the centuries, killing more people worldwide than any other single infectious disease. There is an urgent need for additional strategies which can expedite efforts to combat TB including a preventive vaccine. In this endeavour, we have developed a protocol for a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in India that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two TB vaccines; namely, VPM1002 and Immuvac (M.w) (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii) (MIP) among healthy household contacts (HHCs) of sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. <bold>Methods and analysis</bold> In the three-arm randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial study protocol, a total of 12 000 HHCs (aged 6-99 years) of sputum smear-positive PTB patients will be randomised to receive either of the two vaccine candidates VPM1002 and MIP or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is the prevention of microbiologically confirmed TB. Secondary endpoints will include (1) prevention against Latent TB infection, (2) incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events in study participants, (3) efficacy of vaccine in prevention of PTB/extra PTB in different age groups (6-18 years, 19-35 years, 36-60 years and above 60 years) and (4) immunogenicity of VPM1002 and MIP at month 2 and month 6 after first vaccination in terms of flow cytometric analysis of M.Tb specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting cytokines and Luminex assays for the presence of different cytokines in the sera and supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures stimulated with whole cell lysates of M.Tb and subsequently similar analysis for the cases who develop TB postvaccination during the follow-up period. <bold>Ethics and dissemination</bold> Ethics committees' approvals have been granted by the Institutional Human Ethics Committees of all participating centres in this study and the names of the ethics committees and approvals are as follows: (1) National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT)-Chennai (including subsites): ECR/135/Inst/TN/2013/RR-19, Approval No. 390/NIRT-Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)/2018 dated 5 December 2018 (NIRT-Madurai-ECR/1365/Inst/TN/2020; approval dated 8 June 2020; NIRT, Vellore: ECR/1215/Inst/TN/2019; approval dated 26 September 2020); (2) All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi (including subsites)-Institute Ethics Committee, ECR/547/Inst/DL/2014/RR-17 ECR/538/Inst/DL/2014/RR-20; approval No.IEC-385/06-07-2018, approval OP-28/05.04.2019 and SFH- ECR/593/Inst/DL/2014/RR-20 IEC/VMMC/SJH/project/2019-05/25 ; 23 May 2019; (3) National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD), Delhi: ECR/315/Inst/DL/2013/RR-19; approval IEC-No-NITRD/EC/2019/9004; 8 January 2019; (4) Pune-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and subsite-ECR/23/Inst/MH/2013/RR-19; IEC-NARI/EC/approval/2018/196; 29 May 2018; (5) Regional Medical Research Centre-Bhubaneshwar-ECR/911/Inst/OR-2017/RR-21; approval, dated 25 April 2018; Subsites- AIIMS, Bhubaneshwar ECR/534/Inst/OD/2014/RR-17 and 20 approval No. T/EMF/Pulm.

AB  - Background and rationale: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the major causes of early mortality among children undergoing induction chemotherapy for haematological malignancies. FN occurs in up to 80 % of the children undergoing intensive chemotherapy and FN specific mortality is as high as 10 %. The management of high-risk FN (HR-FN) is by early initiation of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) which is continued till blood count recovery. Adverse effects of prolonged EAT among children without proven infective focus have questioned the rationale behind the duration of EAT. The non inferiority of early stoppage of EAT in patients with low-risk FN (LR-FN) when afebrile for 48 h, irrespective of marrow recovery, is proven among adults and children. However, there is paucity of data regarding the same in children with HR-FN. This study aims to determine whether early discontinuation of EAT in children with HR-FN without proven infective focus who become afebrile and awaiting marrow recovery, would reduce antibiotic duration and their adverse effects without any negative consequences for patients. Objective: To compare the rates of recurrent fever in paediatric patients (2-18 years) with HR-FN when EAT is continued till marrow recovery (control group) versus when stopped early at defervescence irrespective of marrow recovery (study group). Methodology: This is the study protocol of a phase 3, single centre, randomized, open label, non-inferiority clinical trial. The primary outcome is the rate of fever recurrence among patients with HR-FN, when EAT is stopped early irrespective of marrow recovery (study group) and will be compared to the rate of fever recurrence on continuation of EAT till marrow recovery which is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 500/mm3 3 (control group). Secondary outcomes include the comparison of duration of antibiotic use, mortality rates, hospital re-admission rates, requirement of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, therapeutic anti-fungal usage and need for organ support between the study and the control groups. A total of 280 children with acute leukaemia undergoing EAT for grade 3 or severe FN (ANC <500/mu L) without clinico-laboratory evidence of infective foci are being randomized in the ratio of 1:1 between the study and the control group after defervescence for 48 h. The patients will be followed up for primary outcome (fever recurrence) till the end of induction period (day 35) or recovery of ANC >= 500/mm( 3) whichever is earlier. Expected outcome: ESAT-HR FN study is the first large phase 3 randomised study to assess the impact of early stoppage of EAT irrespective of marrow recovery among a homogenous paediatric cohort of HR-FN in the setting of induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. This study will be seminal in addressing the duration of EAT in HR-FN among children without infective foci and if proven to be non-inferior this strategy will help to reduce the adverse effects from prolonged antibiotic use, the emergence of drug resistance, decrease hospital stay length and overall health care costs.

AB  - Timely diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is of paramount importance to improve survival. The Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition invited national and international experts to identify and review important management and research questions. These covered the definition, age appropriate stepwise workup for the etiology, non-invasive diagnosis and management of cerebral edema, prognostic scores, criteria for listing for liver transplantation (LT) and bridging therapies in PALF. Statements and recommendations based on evidences assessed using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system were developed, deliberated and critically reappraised by circulation. The final consensus recommendations along with relevant published background information are presented here. We expect that these recommendations would be followed by the pediatric and adult medical fraternity to improve the outcomes of PALF patients.

AB  - ObjectivesTo estimate the prevalence and predictors of disease-related damage in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in a resource-limited setting.MethodsA single-centre study was conducted from January 2021 - December 2022. Children (<= 18 y) diagnosed with JIA as per International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria, with a disease duration of more than one year, were enrolled for this study. The articular and extra-articular damage was assessed using the juvenile arthritis damage index (JADI) and modified JADI scores. Disease activity and disabilities were evaluated using the clinical juvenile arthritis disease activity score (cJADAS) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ).ResultsOne hundred and five children [44% (n = 42) boys] with JIA were enrolled in the study. The mean (SD) age of children at enrolment was 158 (46.2) mo. The median (IQR) disease duration was 48 (36-72) mo. Articular damage (JADI score >= 1) was present in 48.6%, and extra-articular damage (JADI-E >= 1) was observed in 21.9% of children. Half of the children (n = 22) with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) had joint damage (modified JADI score >= 1). Four children had ocular damage due to uveitis. Among the factors associated with articular damage, the odds of articular damage were high in those with positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and/ or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCPs) [OR: 4.4, 95% CI (1.00-19.60)].Conclusions48.6% of children with JIA had articular damage, while 21.9% of the children had extra-articular damage. Children with RF and/ or anti-CCP positivity are associated with higher odds of joint damage.

AB  - Imaging is a key component of diagnosis and treatment response evaluation of urinary tract tuberculosis (UT TB). Tuberculosis can have a long latency, but if found early, one may have the opportunity to prevent complications such as ureteral strictures, obstructive nephropathy, contracted (thimble) bladder, renal parenchymal destruction/calcification, and renal failure. Imaging can aid in diagnosis and differential diagnoses, evaluate the extent of disease and complications, and guide image-directed biopsy, surgical planning, and evaluation of treatment response. Imaging abnormalities in the renal parenchyma and urinary tract at different stages of the disease, lymphadenopathy, and extra-urinary tract organ involvement are suggestive of UT TB. Recent advances in imaging modalities aid in UT TB diagnosis, follow-up, and guiding treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Cyst formation after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a rare, delayed but important complication. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment is essential for good outcome. Methods: We analysed our institute's Gamma knife treatment records from 2008 to 2023 and analysed AVM treated patients by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Patients with cyst formation and with adequate follow up were identified. Clinical details, management and prognosis of these patients was studied in detail along with prior literature review. Results: A total of 921 AVM patients were treated in the above period and 7 patients were identified with cyst formation. The mean nidus volume was 12.98 ml, the mean radio surgical marginal dose was 23.57 Gy and maximal dose 47.21 Gy. The mean interval gap between SRS and cyst detection was 6.45 years. The mean volume of cyst cavity formed was 47.85 ml. Patients presented either with features of raised intracranial pressure (3) or focal neurological deficits (3) or seizures (1). 3 patients had achieved angiographic nidus obliteration at the time of cyst detection. Treatment was mostly on surgical lines with cyst fenestration(2 patients), excision (3 patients) and emergency decompressive craniectomy (1 patient). 1 patient required additional Ommaya insertion. Conservative management was followed for 1 patient. Residual nidus was treated either by concomitant excision or embolization or redo GKRS. Favourable outcome was seen in 6 out of 7 patients (85.71%) post cyst management with symptomatic and radiological improvement whereas 1 patient (14.28%) died due to refractory status epilepticus secondary to malignant cerebral edema. Conclusion: Cyst formation after GKRS for AVM treatment is an often-neglected complication due to its low incidence and often long latency period. Long term follow up of patients is hence necessary for prompt recognition. Diagnostic DSA should be done in all patients with cysts to look for residual nidus. Asymptomatic ones can be followed up conservatively while surgical treatment is required for symptomatic cases. Ventricular diversion like Ommaya or cystoperitoneal shunt may be necessary in some cases. Treatment outcome is usually favourable provided timely detection is done.

AB  - Lipid nanoparticles have been recognized as a powerful weapon for delivering various imaging and therapeutic agents to the localized solid tumors, especially brain tumors individually or in combination. Promisingly, lipid-based nanosystems have been considered as safe delivery systems which are even approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). One recent spotlight of lipid nanoparticles as COVID-19 mRNA vaccines where lipid nanoparticles play an important role in effectively protecting and delivering mRNA to the desired cells. As of now, successive progress in lipid-based nanocarriers, viz., nanoliposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, ionizable lipid nanostructures, etc., with better biochemical and biophysical stabilities, has been noticed and reported. Moreover, lipid nanostructures have been considered as versatile therapeutics platforms for a variety of diseases due to their biocompatibility, ability to protect and deliver therapeutics to the localized site, and better reproducibility and reliability. However, lipid nanoparticles still face morphological and biochemical changes upon their in vivo administration. These changes alter the specific biological and pathological response of lipid nanoparticles during their personalized brain tumor theranostics. Second, lipid nanomedicine still faces major challenges of zero premature leakage of loaded cargo, long-term colloidal stability, and off targeting. Herein, various lipid-based nanomedicines for brain tumor imaging and therapeutics "theranostics" have been reviewed and summarized considering major aspects of preclinical and clinical studies. On the other hand, engineering and biological challenges of lipid theranostics systems with relevant advantages and guidelines for clinical practice for different brain tumors have also been discussed. This review provides in-depth knowledge of lipid nanoparticle-based theranostics agents for brain tumor imaging and therapeutics.

TI  - A cascade training protocol for schoolteachers on oral health: Investigating the influence of primary and secondary mentors
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background Oral health holds paramount importance for overall well-being, particularly among school-aged children, where inadequate oral health can cause significant discomfort and impede educational performance. Despite its critical nature, oral health awareness and practices within Indian school communities remain suboptimal. There exists an urgent necessity for efficacious educational initiatives to bridge this gap and foster oral health awareness among both schoolteachers and students.Protocol This monitored training introduces a pioneering cascade model training initiative aimed at evaluating its impact on enhancing oral health knowledge among schoolteachers and students in Indian schools. A total of 100 school teachers from 50 Centre government schools will undergo training in two distinct sessions. Following this, two teachers from each school will be selected to further train 24 class monitors from grades 6-9, who will subsequently impart knowledge to approximately 40 students per class. This phase of the training will be ongoing, ensuring training consistency through online supervision and active participation of the expert team in training activities with newly designated master trainers. Pre- and post-training assessments will be conducted at each level to gauge the monitored training's effectiveness. The entire training is projected to conclude within a year.Discussion This cascade model monitored training initiative represents a novel approach in promoting oral health awareness in Indian schools, marking a pioneering endeavor in this domain. Through this program, we aim to empower 1200 class monitors as master trainers and reach approximately 24,000 school students across 480 supervised training sessions. The establishment of master trainers through a cascade process, coupled with the engagement of the CDER expert team, ensures accurate dissemination of information at every stage. The comprehensive evaluation facilitated by pre- and post-training assessments at each level further enhances the program's effectiveness, laying a solid foundation for future oral health initiatives within school communities.

AB  - Introduction: This study conducts the first meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the aggregated risk of malignancy associated with each category of the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology (PSC) system for reporting respiratory cytology. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords "(Lung, Respiratory specimens) AND (Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology System)." Articles were assessed for risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. After excluding inadequate samples, sensitivity and specificity for various cut-off points. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves and diagnostic odds ratios were pooled to assess diagnostic accuracy. Results: Five studies, totaling 3,489 cases, were included. Sensitivity and specificity for the "Atypical and higher risk categories" considered positive were 60% (95% CI, 51-68%) and 87% (95% CI, 81-92%), respectively. For the "Suspicious for malignancy and higher risk categories" considered positive, sensitivity and specificity were 49% (95% CI, 40-58%) and 95% (95% CI, 92-97%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the "Malignant" category considered positive for malignancy were 42% (95% CI, 33-52%) and 97% (95% CI, 92-99%), respectively. The pooled area under the curve ranged from 68 to 75% for each cut-off. Conclusion: This meta-analysis underscores the PSC system's accuracy in reporting respiratory cytology. It highlights the diagnostic importance of the "Suspicious" and "Malignant" categories in identifying malignancy, and the utility of the "Atypical" category for initial screening. These findings support the PSC system's role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making in respiratory cytology.

AB  - Variant anatomy in the axillary region is of great clinical significance. It is one of the most frequently accessed regions for radical dissection surgery. During routine dissection of embalmed cadavers, we found a rare case of two accessory muscular slips emerging from the lateral border of latissimus dorsi (LD) and the inferolateral border of pectoralis major (PM), crossing the neurovascular structures in the axilla and merging distally together to the brachial fascia at the upper end of humerus below the bicipital groove. The accessory slip from LD is commonly referred to as the "axillary arch" in literature. We identified the accessory slip from the PM crossing over the axilla as pectoralis quartus. These aberrant slips can cause neurovascular compression in the axilla and can have clinical implications. Prior knowledge of the variant anatomy is the key to successful surgery in the axilla, thereby avoiding inadvertent injuries and post-operative complications.

AB  - Hypoxic insult to the fetal brain causes loss of vulnerable premyelinating oligodendrocytes and arrested oligodendrocyte differentiation. Astrocytes influence oligodendrocyte differentiation and the astrocytic response to hypoxia could affect oligodendrocyte maturation under hypoxia. To identify pathways by which astrocytes influence oligodendroglial maturation in hypoxic injury, human fetal neural stem cell-derived astrocytes were exposed to 0.2 % oxygen for 48 hours. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation of the cholesterolbiosynthesis pathway in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes. Hypoxia-exposed primary astrocytes and astrocytic cell line (SVG) showed increased expression of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), squalene epoxidase (SQLE), apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) on qPCR and Western blot. Hypoxic SVG also showed increased cholesterol content in cells and culture supernatants and increased cell surface expression of ABCA1. Interestingly hypoxia-exposed premyelinating oligodendrocytes (Mo3.13) showed reduced cholesterol along with decreased expression of HMGCR and SQLE on qPCR and Western blot. Exogenous cholesterol increased the differentiation of Mo3.13 as measured by increased expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) on flow cytometry. Hypoxia exposure resulted in increased cholesterol transport from astrocytes to oligodendrocytes in cocultures with BODIPY-cholesterol labelled SVG and membrane-labelled Mo3.13. As exogenous cholesterol enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation, our findings indicate that increased cholesterol synthesis by astrocytes and transport to oligodendrocytes could supplement oligodendroglial maturation in conditions of hypoxic brain injury in neonates.

AB  - Background: Escherichia coli is a Gram-negative commensal of human gut. Surprisingly, the role of E. coli in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been explored until now. Methods: Human gut microbiota composition and meta-gut resistome were evaluated using metagenomics. Antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli isolates against different class of antibiotics was investigated. Further, the genome sequence analysis of E. coli isolates was performed to gain insight into the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanism and virulence factors. Gut proteome of UC and non-UC was examined to understand the effect of resistant bacteria on host physiology. Results: In UC patients, meta-gut resistome was found to be dominated by AMR genes (829) compared to healthy controls (HC) [518]. The metagenome study revealed a higher prevalence of AMR genes in the rural population (378 in HC; 607 in UC) compared to the urban (340 in HC; 578 in UC). Approximately, 40% of all E. coli isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR), with higher prevalence in UC (43.75%) compared to HC (33.33%). Up-regulated expression of antimicrobial human proteins (lactotransferrin, azurocidin, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and neutrophil defensin 3) and inflammatory mediator (Protein S100-A9 and Protein S100-A8) suggest microbial infection in UC gut. Conclusions: In addition to the conventional culturomics method, a multi-omics strategy provides deeper insights into the disease etiology, emergence of MDR pathobionts, and their roles in the disruption of the healthy gut environment in UC patients.

AB  - Introduction: Pediatric orbital tumors encompass a wide spectrum of neoplasms, many of which are malignant small round cell tumors with overlapping histology. Sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations are undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS) characterized by BCOR rearrangements or internal tandem duplications, having distinct clinical features. Being previously unrecognized in the orbit, they have potential for misdiagnosis. Patients: We describe two cases of orbital sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations. Results: Both girls, 8 and 16 months of age, respectively, presented with progressive proptosis. Both tumors showed sheets of round to ovoid cells with monomorphic nuclei and frequent mitoses. Delicate branching capillaries and myxoid stroma were absent. Diffuse BCOR, cyclin D1, and SATB2 immunopositivity was present. Conclusion: Orbital sarcomas with BCOR genetic alterations are extremely rare. Pathologists should have high index of suspicion for novel genetically defined entities in the differential diagnosis of pediatric orbital URCS and perform appropriate ancillary tests for accurate diagnosis.

AB  - IntroductionThe population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in India is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. India instituted a targeted intervention (TI) programme to reduce this vulnerability. We aimed to measure the assessment of the TI programme for MSM.Materials and MethodsThe national Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey (IBBS) was carried out in 2014-2015. We analysed MSM data from the IBBS and used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to calculate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The use of a condom during their last sexual intercourse and consistent condom use during the previous month were considered indicators of programme effectiveness. The propensity score matching method was used to assess the effectiveness of the TI programme.ResultsThe matched-samples estimate (i.e., average treatment effect on treated) for the use of condoms during their last sexual intercourse increased by 10.0% (0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.12), and consistent condom use during the previous month increased by 9.0% (0.09; 95% CI 0.07-0.10) among those who had received condoms from the peer educator/outreach worker compared with those who had not received condoms.ConclusionsThe TI programme intervention among MSM was effective in reducing HIV risk behaviours, as evidenced by an increase in the use of condoms during their last sexual intercourse and consistent condom use during the last month.

AB  - Background: & objective: : The existence of visually identical cryptic Aspergillus species that can be distinguished only by molecular techniques is becoming more widely acknowledged. For the majority of antifungal drugs, these are known to exhibit a greater minimal inhibitory concentration in vitro. For the purpose of receiving the proper care, it is crucial to identify these species at right time. Our aim in this work is to identify and describe the Aspergillus species that are cryptic from all of the clinical samples. Methods: Routine samples from inpatients and outpatients received in department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, showing growth of Aspergillus species were included in this study. Phenotypic and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation- Time of Flight identified isolates were analysed for cryptic species, by PCR and ITS/f3 - tubulin sequencing. In accordance with CLSI recommendations, antifungal susceptibility testing was conducted using micro broth dilution. Results: Of the 94 isolates, 54 A. fumigatus, , 34 A. flavus, , 3 A. nidulans, , 2 A. terreus, and 1 A. niger were morphologically identified. MALDI-TOF misidentified 2 A. nidulans isolates and 1 A, stellatus isolate. The f3 - tubulin sequence analysis revealed that 2 isolates (2.08 %) were cryptic, one was A. stellatus and another one was A. tubingensis. .

AB  - Introduction The increasing interest in teledentistry since the COVID-19 pandemic warrants an evaluation of dentists' willingness to adopt it. This study aimed to develop a questionnaire to assess dentist's intention to use teledentistry and the associated factors. Methods A literature search was used to identify items for the questionnaire. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was adopted as framework. A Delphi panel was constituted of researchers with relevant publications and the International Association of Dental Research e-Oral Health Network members. Three Delphi consultations were conducted to establish consensus on items. Consensus was set at 80% agreement and content validity ratio (CVR), reaffirmed iteratively. Results Nineteen out of 25 (76%) invited experts participated in the first round, 17 in the second and 15 in the third. The preliminary questionnaire had 81 items in three sections, reduced to 66, 45 and 33 items in the first, second and third rounds. After revision, the final version comprised eight items assessing dentists' backgrounds in Sect. 1, seven items identifying teledentistry uses in Sect. 2, and 17 items assessing intention to use teledentistry and its determinants in seven dimensions in Sect. 3. The initial CVR was 0.45, which increased to 0.80 at the end of the third round. Conclusion A survey tool was developed to assess the acceptance of teledentistry, and its determinants based on the UTAUT2 framework through consensus among teledentistry experts. The tool had excellent validity and needs further evaluation of its psychometric properties.

Ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fractures alone impact an estimated 1.71 billion people worldwide. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in interacting with the host through the synthesis of a diverse range of metabolites called gut-associated metabolites (GAMs), which originate from external dietary substrates or endogenous host compounds. Many metabolic disorders have been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota's activity and composition. The development of metabolic illnesses has been linked to certain microbiota-derived metabolites, such as branched-chain amino acids, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan, trimethylamine N-oxide, and indole derivatives. Moreover, the modulation of gut microbiota through biotics (prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics) presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Biotics selectively promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, thereby enhancing the production of GAMs with potential beneficial effects on bone metabolism. Understanding the intricate interplay between GAMs, and bone-associated genes through molecular informatics holds significant promise for early diagnosis, prognosis, and novel treatment strategies for various bone disorders.

AB  - Objectives: The study compared real-time motor cortex excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived parameters between children with epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS) and age-matched neurotypical controls. The EE-SWAS group received steroids as standard of care and were longitudinally followed for three months. Materials & Methods: Children aged 5-12 years with immunotherapy-naive EE-SWAS (spike-wave-index >= 50 %) and neurotypical controls were enrolled. Cognitive and behavioral assessments were performed using valid psychometric tools. Real-time motor cortex excitability was assessed by measuring resting motor threshold (RMT), short intra-cortical inhibition (SICI) and long intra-cortical inhibition (LICI) in both groups. In EE-SWAS group, a follow up evaluation with TMS at 4- and 12-week intervals, EEG, and neurobehavioral assessments at 12-weeks were performed to assess the effect of steroids on cortical excitability and to determine electroclinical outcome. Results: Forty-eight children with suspected EE-SWAS and 26 neurotypical controls were screened; 20 were enrolled in each group. Children with EE-SWAS (mean age: 8.05 +/- 1.76 years) had cognitive and behavioral problems (20/20), and ongoing seizures (12/20). At baseline, the dominant motor cortex was significantly inhibited in the EE-SWAS group compared to neurotypical children{RMT(%)[86.3 +/- 6.96 vs 58.05 +/- 4.71(p < 0.0001)]; LICI(%)[55.05 +/- 4.39 vs 73.9 +/- 3.75(p < 0.0001)]; SICI(%)[39.2 +/- 4.36 vs 55.45 +/- 4.78(p < 0.0001)]}. Reversal of motor cortex inhibition was sequentially observed in EE-SWAS group at 4- and 12-week follow-ups{(RMT[4, 12 weeks]: 71.45 +/- 9.83, 63.45 +/- 8.48); (LICI[4, 12 weeks]: 66.00 +/- 6.26, 74.50 +/- 5.36); (SICI[4, 12 weeks]: 49.35 +/- 6.24, 56.05 +/- 5.57)}[repeated-measures ANOVA: p < 0.0001]. Conclusion: Motor cortex is remotely inhibited in EE-SWAS, which may contribute to neurobehavioral impairment. Steroids can disinhibit/reverse the epilepsy-induced motor cortex inhibition leading to improvement in neurobehavior.

AB  - Regarding medico-legal malpractice suits, lawyers and insurers focus on informed consent documentation. Unfortunately, there is no standard protocol for obtaining informed consent for platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections. The objective of the present study was to create a pre-designed, evidence-based informed consent form specifically for PRP injections. The current evidence on the medico-legal implications of PRP injections was accessed, as well as informed consent in general and specifically informed consent in PRP injections. Additionally, we interviewed orthopaedic surgeons and patients who had undergone PRP injections in the past year using a semi-structured approach. A legally valid and evidence-based informed consent form for PRP injections ensures rights, encouraging open communication and transparency between the patient and surgeon. Moreover, if a lawsuit arose, informed consent would be a critical document in surgeons' defence and would withstand scrutiny from lawyers and the judiciary. An evidence-based informed consent form for PRP injections was elaborated and reviewed by a legal expert to ensure adherence to legal proprieties. The final form of the informed consent for PRP injection was administered for one year and validated at our institution.

AB  - IntroductionLaparoscopic cholecystectomy, a widely performed procedure globally, often results in post-operative pain, which impacts the length of hospital stay and imposes financial burdens. This randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of pre-emptive versus post-operative local anaesthetic infiltration at port-site incisions on post-operative pain in laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients.Patients and methodsThis double-blinded study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital, included 50 patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and were divided into two groups: Pre-emptive analgesia (group A) and post-operative analgesia (group B). Randomization was performed with sealed envelopes, and patients were evaluated preoperatively. Pain scores, shoulder pain incidence, hospital stay duration, analgesic requirements, and return to normal activity were compared between the groups.ResultsBaseline demographic profiles were comparable. Pre-emptive analgesia demonstrated significantly lower Visual Analogue Scale scores at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 h, and 7 days post-operatively with no significant difference in shoulder pain incidence. Pre-emptive analgesia correlated with a markedly shorter hospital stay reduced analgesic requirements, and an earlier return to normal activity. Only 10% of patients from the post-operative analgesia group required additional analgesia.ConclusionPre-emptive local anaesthetic infiltration at port sites yielded significant benefits, including reduced pain, lower analgesic requirements, shorter hospital stays, and earlier resumption of routine activities compared to post-operative infiltration.Trial RegistrationThis project is registered under the Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI) CTRI Number: CTRI/2023/08/056175 [Registered on: 07/08/2023]-trial registered prospectively

AB  - Background: India relies primarily on direct smear microscopy for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. However, the low sensitivity of smear microscopy emphasizes the need to improve its performance. We recently described the development of 'TBDetect' kit which showed improved performance over direct smear microscopy at National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) in India. Methods: The present study was aimed to assess the operational feasibility of 'TBDetect' microscopy in field settings. This was evaluated by (i) assessing the performance of 'TBDetect' microscopy vs. LED-fluorescence microscopy (LED-FM) on consecutive presumptive pulmonary TB patients (n = 5300) who attended Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs, n = 13) under 4 NRLs at Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Chennai, and New Delhi, and (ii) obtaining feedback from Scientists (n = 10) and laboratory technicians (n = 42) using semi-structured questionnaires under the following parameters: feasibility of initiation of 'TBDetect' microscopy in DMCs, sample preparation and testing, training, time-to-result, logistics, and troubleshooting. A scoring questionnaire was also used to assess 'TBDetect' microscopy vs. LED-FM and statistical significance of the scores was calculated using paired t-test. Results: The overall positivity of 'TBDetect' microscopy was 10.32% (547/5300) vs. 8.96% (475/5300) of LED-FM at all sites and the increment in positivity was significant (p = 0.019). In addition, 'TBDetect' microscopy yielded an increment in smear grade status over LED-FM (p = 0.043). The feedback from the study-in-charge and kit users indicated that 'TBDetect' microscopy was easily adapted in point-of-care settings. An analysis of scoring feedback suggested that it was easy to perform and observe in comparison to LED-FM (p < 0.005). Conclusions: This study established the feasibility of 'TBDetect' microscopy in field settings.

AB  - Background Limited data, primarily from small case series, exist regarding the clinical profile, genetic variants, and outcomes of WDR72-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (WDR72-dRTA). Methods Our study enrolled children diagnosed with WDR72-dRTA below 18 years of age from 9 Indian centers and analyzed their clinical characteristics, genetic profiles, and outcomes. Potential genotype-phenotype correlations were explored. Results We report 22 patients (59% female) with WDR72-dRTA who were diagnosed at a median age of 5.3 (3, 8) years with polyuria (n = 17; 77.3%), poor growth (16; 72.7%), and rickets (9; 40.9%). Amelogenesis imperfecta was present in 21 (95.5%) cases. At presentation, all patients had normal anion gap metabolic acidosis; hypokalemia and nephrocalcinosis were seen in 17 (77.3%) patients each. Seven (31.8%) patients had concomitant proximal tubular dysfunction. Genetic analysis identified biallelic nonsense variants in 18 (81.8%) patients, including novel variants in 6 cases. A previously reported variant, c.88C > T, and a novel variant, c.655C > T, were the most frequent variants, accounting for 10 (45.5%) cases. Over a median follow-up of 1.3 (1, 8) years, the height velocity improved by 0.74 (0.2, 1.2) standard deviation scores, while 3 children (13.6%) progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2, with eGFR ranging from 67 to 76 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively, after 11.3-16 years of follow-up. No specific genotype-phenotype correlation could be established. Conclusions WDR72-dRTA should be considered in children with typical features of amelogenesis imperfecta and dRTA. Biallelic nonsense variants are common in Asians. While most patients respond well to treatment with improved growth and preserved eGFR, on long-term follow-up, a decline in eGFR may occur.

AB  - Objective(s): To evaluate and compare diagnostic performance of ultrasound-based reporting systems IOTA SR, ADNEX, GIRADS, ORADS for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Study design: A prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital's Obstetrics and Gynaecology department evaluated pre-operative ultrasound imaging for adnexal masses in 80 cases, comparing various reporting systems' sensitivity and specificity against histopathology as gold standard using STATA version 17.0 for data analysis. Results: Among the 80 masses, 55 % (44/80) were confirmed as benign on histopathology, while 45 % were identified as malignant. The sensitivity and specificity of SR was 100 % (95 %CI: 90.0-100) and 97.1 % (95 %CI: 84.7-99.9) respectively. Eleven masses (13.8 %) were inconclusive, reducing specificity to 75 % (95 % CI:59.7-86.8). In ADNEX optimal cut-off for risk of malignancy was 34.1 % with sensitivity of 86.1 % (95% CI: 70.5-95.3) and specificity of 90.9% (95% CI: 78.3-97.5). Considering GIRADS 4-5 and risk threshold of >= 10 % (ORADS 4-5) as predictors of malignancy sensitivity was 100 % (95 %CI: 90.3-100) and specificity was 70.5 % (95 %CI: 54.8-83.2) for GIRADS and ORADS. All reporting systems were comparable (p = 0.7). ADNEX identified 72.7 % (8/11) of inconclusive cases, outperforming GIRADS/ORADS which correctly classified 27.2 % (3/ 11) cases. When applied to misclassified GIRADS/ORADS 4-5 category, ADNEX demonstrated superior performance by correctly classifying 76.9% (10/13) masses, while SR achieved correct classification in only 38.5% (5/ 13) masses. Conclusion(s): All classification systems showed comparable accuracy in malignancy risk identification on imaging. GIRADS/ORADS tended to overestimate malignancy risk. The present study recommends a two-step strategy, leveraging higher specificity of ADNEX model for improved stratification of adnexal masses.

AB  - The possible vulnerability of the male reproductive system to environmental pollutants such as air pollution necessitates a thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of male reproductive function. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of the filtered fraction of diesel exhaust (predominantly comprising gases) on male reproductive function in Wistar rat model. Adult male rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n=8/group): Control (unexposed) group (CG-A), the Clean air group in WBE chamber (CAG-A), and Filtered diesel exhaust group in WBE chamber (FDG-A). The exposure protocol for CAG-A and FDG-A was 6 h/day x 5d/week x 6 weeks,evaluation of sperm parameters, testicular histopathology, quantification of hormones (testosterone, LH, FSH, 17(3-Estradiol, and prolactin), and GST levels were performed. Results showed that WBE to FDE leads to a significant decline in sperm concentration (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.014, CAG-A vs FDG-A), motility (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.029, CAG-A vs FDG-A), serum testosterone (p=0.024, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.007, CAG-A vs FDG-A), testicular testosterone (p=0.008, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.028, CAG-A vs FDG-A), 17(3-Estradiol (p=0.007, CG-A vs FDG-A), and GST levels (p=0.0002, CG-A vs FDG-A; p=0.0019, CAG-A vs FDG-A). These findings demonstrate the disruption of testosterone-estradiol balance in the intratesticular milieu without significant alterations in other principal pituitary hormones in adult rats exposed to FDE. The predominant presence of gaseous components in FDE can cause testicular damage due to oxidative imbalance. This underscores the causality of FDE exposure and impaired male reproductive outcomes.

AB  - Background Quality of chronic care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains suboptimal worldwide. The Collaborative Quality ImProvement (C-QIP) trial aims to develop and test the feasibility and clinical effect of a multicomponent strategy among patients with prevalent CVD in India. Methods The C-QIP is a clinic-based, open randomized trial of a multicomponent intervention vs usual care that was locally developed and adapted for use in Indian settings through rigorous formative research guided by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The C-QIP intervention consisted of 5 components: 1) electronic health records and decision support system for clinicians, 2) trained nonphysician health workers (NPHW), 3) text-message based lifestyle reminders, 4) patient education materials, 5) quarterly audit and feedback reports. Patients with CVD (ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) attending outpatient CVD clinics were recruited from September 2022 to September 2023 and were randomized to the intervention or usual care arm for at least 12 months follow-up. The co-primary outcomes are implementation feasibility, fidelity (ie, dose delivered and dose received), acceptability, adoption and appropriateness, measured at multiple levels: patient, provider and clinic site-level, The secondary outcomes include prescription of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) (provider-level), and adherence to prescribed therapy, change in mean blood pressure (BP) and LDL-cholesterol between the intervention and control groups (patient-level). In addition, a trial-based process and economic evaluations will be performed using standard guidelines. Results We recruited 410 socio-demographically diverse patients with CVD from 4 hospitals in India. Mean (SD) age was 57.5 (11.7) years, and 73.0% were males. Self-reported history of hypertension (48.5%) and diabetes (41.5%) was common. At baseline, mean (SD) BP was 127.9 (18.2) /76.2 (11.6) mm Hg, mean (SD) LDLc: 80.3 (37.3) mg/dl and mean (SD) HbA1c: 6.8% (1.6%). At baseline, the GDMT varied from 62.4% for patients with ischemic heart disease, 48.6% for ischemic stroke and 36.1% for heart failure. Conclusion This study will establish the feasibility of delivering contextually relevant, and evidence-based C-QIP strategy and assess whether it is acceptable to the target populations. The study results will inform a larger scale confirmatory trial of a comprehensive CVD care model in low-resource settings.

AB  - Introduction People with diabetes are at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. However, limited data are available to quantify their risk of kidney function decline in South Asia. This study evaluates the rate and predictors of kidney function decline among people with type 2 diabetes in South Asia.Research design and methods We analyzed data from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Trial to quantify the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in people with type 2 diabetes (n=1146) over 2.5 years of follow-up. The CARRS Trial evaluated a multicomponent intervention of decision-supported electronic health records and non-physician care coordinator to improve diabetes management at 10 diabetes clinics in India and Pakistan. We used linear mixed models to estimate eGFR slope among all participants and tested the association of eGFR slope with demographic, disease-related, and self-care parameters, accounting for randomization and site.Results The mean age of participants was 54.2 years, with a median duration of diabetes of 7.0 years (IQR: 3.0 - 12.0) and median CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) eGFR of 83.6 (IQR: 67.7 to 97.9) mL/min/1.73 m2. The overall mean eGFR slope was -1.33/mL/min/1.73 m2/year. There were no differences in the eGFR slope by treatment assignment to intervention versus usual care. In the adjusted regression model, pre-existing diabetic retinopathy (slope difference: -2.11; 95% CI: -3.45 to -0.77), previous cardiovascular disease (-1.93; 95% CI: -3.45 to -0.40), and statins use (-0.87; 95% CI: -1.65 to -0.10) were associated with faster eGFR decline.Conclusions People with diabetes receiving care at urban diabetes clinics in South Asia experienced annual eGFR decline at two times higher rate than that reported from other contemporary international diabetes cohorts. Risk factors for faster decline were similar to those previously established, and thus care delivery models must put an additional emphasis on kidney protective therapies among subgroups with microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications.Trial registration number NCT01212328.

AB  - The avascular nature of cartilage tissue limits inherent regenerative capacity to counter any damage and this has become a substantial burden to the health of individuals. As a result, there is a high demand to repair and regenerate cartilage. Existing tissue engineering approaches for cartilage regeneration typically produce either microporous or nano-fibrous scaffolds lacking the desired biological outcome due to lack of biomimetic dual architecture of microporous construct with nano-fibrous interconnected structures like the native cartilage. Most of these scaffolds also fail to suppress ROS generation and provide sustained bioenergetics to cells, resulting in the loss of metabolic activity under avascular microenvironment of cartilage. A dual architecture microporous construct with nano-fibrous interconnected network of cellulose aerogel reinforced with arginine-coated graphene oxide (CNF-GO-Arg aerogel) was developed for cartilage regeneration. The designed dual-architectured CNF-GO-Arg aerogel using dual ice templating assembly demonstrates 80 % strain recovery ability under compression. The release of Arginine from CNF-GO-Arg aerogel supported 41 % reduction in intracellular ROS activity and promoted chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs by shifting mitochondrial bioenergetics towards oxidative phosphorylation indicated by JC-1 dye staining. Overall developed CNF-GO-Arg aerogel provided multifunctionality via biomimetic morphology, cellular bioenergetics, and suppressed ROS generation to address the need for regeneration of cartilage.

TI  - WHO global research priorities for sexually transmitted infections
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are widespread worldwide and negatively affect sexual and reproductive health. Gaps in evidence and in available tools have long hindered STI programmes and policies, particularly in resourcelimited settings. In 2022, WHO initiated a research prioritisation process to identify the most important STI research areas to address the global public health need. Using an adapted Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology including two global stakeholder surveys, the process identified 40 priority STI research needs. The top priorities centred on developing and implementing affordable, feasible, rapid point-of-care STI diagnostic tests and new treatments, especially for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis; designing new multipurpose prevention technologies and vaccines for STIs; and collecting improved STI epidemiologic data on both infection and disease outcomes. The priorities also included innovative programmatic approaches, such as new STI communication and partner management strategies. An additional six research areas related to mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) reflect the need for STIrelated research during disease outbreaks where sexual transmission can have a key role. These STI research priorities provide a call to action for focus, investment, and innovation to address existing roadblocks in STI prevention, control, and management to advance sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing for all.

AB  - Objective: Although previous studies have described phenomenological diagnoses, they lacked description of aetiological spectrum in patients visiting movement disorders (MD) service. Herein, we classify the MD phenomenology and describe aetiology wise distribution of each phenomenology in patients visiting a tertiary care movement disorders service. Methods: Collected information included demographic profile (age of onset, age at presentation, gender, duration of illness before presentation), predominant MD phenomenology [such as parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia, tremor, chorea, ballism, myoclonus, tics, stereotypy, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and others], diagnostic evaluations and detected aetiology. Results: This observational study included 1140 MD patients over a span of 5 years. The median (IQR) age of onset was 49 (35-60) years and age at presentation was 54 (40-65) years, with median duration of illness being 36 (18-72) months. Nearly two-third of patients were males (M:F=731:409). Parkinsonism (n=494, 43.3%) was the most common MD phenomenology observed, followed by dystonia (n=219, 19.2 %), ataxia (n=125, 11 %), tremor (n=118, 10.4 %), myoclonus (n=73, 6.4 %), chorea (n=40, 3.5 %), spasticity (n=22, 1.9 %), tics (n=8, 0.7 %), and RLS (n=8, 0.7 %). Thirty-three (2.9 %) patients were grouped under miscellaneous MDs. Overall, neurodegenerative disorders (57.4 %) were the most common cause of MDs. Parkinson's disease, genetic dystonia, essential tremor, genetic ataxias, hemifacial spasm, and Huntington's disease were the most common aetiologies for parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, myoclonus, and chorea, respectively. Conclusion: Parkinsonism was the most common phenomenology observed in MD patients, and was followed by dystonia, ataxia and tremor. Neurodegenerative disorders were the most common aetiology detected.

AB  - Importance More than 150 million people in India need mental health care but few have access to affordable care, especially in rural areas. Objective To determine whether a multifaceted intervention involving a digital health care model along with a community-based antistigma campaign leads to reduced depression risk and lower mental health-related stigma among adults residing in rural India. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, cluster randomized, usual care-controlled trial was conducted from September 2020 to December 2021 with blinded follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months at 44 rural primary health centers across 3 districts in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh states in India. Adults aged 18 years and older at high risk of depression or self-harm defined by either a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) score of 10 or greater, a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7) score of 10 or greater, or a score of 2 or greater on the self-harm/suicide risk question on the PHQ-9. A second cohort of adults not at high risk were selected randomly from the remaining screened population. Data were cleaned and analyzed from April 2022 to February 2023. Interventions The 12-month intervention included a community-based antistigma campaign involving all participants and a digital mental health intervention involving only participants at high risk. Primary health care workers were trained to identify and manage participants at high risk using the Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines from the World Health Organization. Main Outcomes and Measures The 2 coprimary outcomes assessed at 12 months were mean PHQ-9 scores in the high-risk cohort and mean behavior scores in the combined high-risk and non-high-risk cohorts using the Mental Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior scale. Results Altogether, 9928 participants were recruited (3365 at high risk and 6563 not at high risk; 5638 [57%] female and 4290 [43%] male; mean [SD] age, 43 [16] years) with 9057 (91.2%) followed up at 12 months. Mean PHQ-9 scores at 12 months for the high-risk cohort were lower in the intervention vs control groups (2.77 vs 4.48; mean difference, -1.71; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.89; P < .001). The remission rate in the high-risk cohort (PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores <5 and no risk of self-harm) was higher in the intervention vs control group (74.7% vs 50.6%; odds ratio [OR], 2.88; 95% CI, 1.53 to 5.42; P = .001). Across both cohorts, there was no difference in 12-month behavior scores in the intervention vs control group (17.39 vs 17.74; mean difference, -0.35; 95% CI, -1.11 to 0.41; P = .36). Conclusions and Relevance A multifaceted intervention was effective in reducing depression risk but did not improve intended help-seeking behaviors for mental illness.

AB  - PurposeIntensive care units (ICUs) have significant palliative care needs but lack a reliable care framework. This umbrella review addresses them by synthesising palliative care practices provided at end-of-life to critically ill patients and their families before, during, and after ICU admission.MethodsSeven databases were systematically searched for systematic reviews, and the umbrella review was conducted according to the guidelines laid out by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).ResultsOut of 3122 initial records identified, 40 systematic reviews were included in the synthesis. Six key themes were generated that reflect the palliative and end-of-life care practices in the ICUs and their outcomes. Effective communication and accurate prognostications enabled families to make informed decisions, cope with uncertainty, ease distress, and shorten ICU stays. Inter-team discussions and agreement on a plan are essential before discussing care goals. Recording care preferences prevents unnecessary end-of-life treatments. Exceptional end-of-life care should include symptom management, family support, hydration and nutrition optimisation, avoidance of unhelpful treatments, and bereavement support. Evaluating end-of-life care quality is critical and can be accomplished by seeking family feedback or conducting a survey.ConclusionThis umbrella review encapsulates current palliative care practices in ICUs, influencing patient and family outcomes and providing insights into developing an appropriate care framework for critically ill patients needing end-of-life care and their families.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of insulin resistance and its association with change in serum anti-seizure medication (ASM) level and their pharmacokinetic, body composition and metabolic hormones after six months of levetiracetam (LEV) exposure in persons with epilepsy (PWE) in comparison to valproate (VPA). Methods: This prospective-longitudinal study included clinically diagnosed PWE on VPA or LEV monotherapy (for<3 months). At enrolment, body weight/composition, BMI were measured and blood samples were collected for assessing metabolic dysfunctions by estimation of serum insulin, insulin resistance [in terms of Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)], leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile along with ASMs level. Subjects were followed up for six months and all the above parameters were reassessed. Results: A total of 150 PWE were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 105 number of subjects were enrolled (n = 35 in VPA and n = 70 in LEV group). Out of them, 92 subjects (n = 32 in VPA; n = 60 in LEV) completed six months follow-up. After six months, serum insulin level increased significantly in VPA group compared to baseline p < 0.001). Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR>2.5) was observed in 14.28 % of PWE in VPA group. Significantly higher percentage-change in body-weight (p = 0.003), leptin and decreased adiponectin were found in VPA-group compared to baseline ((p = 0.003, 0.02, 0.001, <0.001, respectively). These changes were independent of serum level or pharmacokinetic of VPA. On the other hand, no such changes were observed in LEV-group despite increased serum LEV level and altered pharmacokinetic parameters after six months. Conclusion: Six months treatment with VPA resulted in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions in PWE. These alterations were not correlated with change in VPA serum level. These changes were not observed in LEV therapy suggesting its better safety profile. This may be considered while prescribing the ASM like VPA and LEV in adult patients with obesity or insulin resistance and diabetes.

AB  - Difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a condition that every general surgeon has once faced during surgery. There have been various propositions regarding the aetiology and criteria for difficult cholecystectomy. As a whole, it has been associated with abnormal anatomy, frozen Calot's triangle, difficult exposure, post endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, requiring more than 90 min, need for open conversion, etc. There are various preoperative and intraoperative predictors of difficult cholecystectomy described in the literature. However, history of severe pelvic inflammatory disease preoperatively has not been described in the literature as a predictor of difficult cholecystectomy. In our case report, a 31-year-old lady presented to us with biliary colic. Ultrasonography revealed a normal wall gall bladder, with multiple calculi. Diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis was made. Based on clinical history and intraoperative findings, a diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was made, which is a sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease.

AB  - BackgroundCurrently, there is no automated method for assessing cleanliness in video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Our objectives were to automate the process of evaluating and collecting medical scores of VCE frames according to the existing KOrea-CanaDA (KODA) scoring system by developing an easy-to-use mobile application called artificial intelligence-KODA (AI-KODA) score, as well as to determine the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the KODA score among three readers for prospective AI applications, and check the efficacy of the application.MethodFrom the 28 patient capsule videos considered, 1539 sequential frames were selected at five-minute intervals, and 634 random frames were selected at random intervals during small bowel transit. The frames were processed and shifted to AI-KODA. Three readers (gastroenterology fellows), who had been trained in reading VCE, rated 2173 frames in duplicate four weeks apart after completing the training module on AI-KODA. The scores were saved automatically in real time. Reliability was assessed for each video using estimate of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Then, the AI dataset was developed using the frames and their respective scores, and it was subjected to automatic classification of the scores via the random forest and the k-nearest neighbors classifiers.ResultsFor sequential frames, ICCs for inter-rater variability were 'excellent' to 'good' among the three readers, while ICCs for intra-rater variability were 'good' to 'moderate'. For random frames, ICCs for inter-rater and intra-rater variability were 'excellent' among the three readers. The overall accuracy achieved was up to 61% for the random forest classifier and 62.38% for the k-nearest neighbors classifier.ConclusionsAI-KODA automates the process of scoring VCE frames based on the existing KODA score. It saves time in cleanliness assessment and is user-friendly for research and clinical use. Comprehensive benchmarking of the AI dataset is in process.

AB  - Hepatic factors secreted by the liver promote homeostasis and are pivotal for maintaining the liver-gut axis. Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific Rela-Stat3 network as a promising therapeutic target.

AB  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a major global healthcare burden. Current lifelong antiretroviral therapy drastically improves life expectancy but do not cure HIV. Therefore, at the existing growth rates, it is estimated that around 42 million people will be living with HIV by 2030 worldwide. A cure for HIV is need of the hour which could come in the form of remission (durable viral control without ART) or eradication (complete removal of latent replication-competent virus). In this review, we discuss recent advances in basic, applied and clinical aspects of latent HIV reservoirs including its tissue locations, cell types, cell properties, genomic integration sites and its significance, mechanism of reservoir seeding and methods to study the reservoirs. Natural models of functional cure which include elite controllers, viremic controllers, long term non-progressors and post-treatment controllers are discussed. Recent advances towards a functional HIV cure are discussed under headings; CCR5 Delta 32/Delta 32 stem cells transplantation, shock and kill strategy, block and lock strategy, gene therapy and combined strategies.

AB  - Objective: Compare the efficacy and safety of daily versus fortnightly oral vitamin D-3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children aged 1-10 years. Design: Open labelled randomized controlled trial. Patients: Eighty children with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into group daily (D) and group bolus (B) [40 in each group] to receive oral vitamin D-3, 4000 IU daily or 60,000 IU fortnightly for 12 weeks respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium of 500 mg/day. Measurements: Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 74 children were available for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of both regimens. Results: Both regimens led to a significant increase in Ca and P levels and a fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no intergroup difference. At 4- and 12-week assessments, all children in both treatment arms achieved 25(OH)D level in sufficiency range, with no significant difference in their geometric mean. Both regimens were associated with asymptomatic transient hypercalcemia [group D-51.4% vs. group B-34.3%; p -0.14] and hypercalciuria (5.7%) in group D that resolved spontaneously on follow-up. Results: Both regimens led to a significant increase in Ca and P levels and a fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no intergroup difference. At 4- and 12-week assessments, all children in both treatment arms achieved 25(OH)D level in sufficiency range, with no significant difference in their geometric mean. Both regimens were associated with asymptomatic transient hypercalcemia [group D-51.4% vs. group B-34.3%; p -0.14] and hypercalciuria (5.7%) in group D that resolved spontaneously on follow-up. Conclusions: Daily and fortnightly oral vitamin D3 in similar cumulative doses are efficacious for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children (1-10 years). Treated children should be monitored for serum 25(OH)D, Ca and urinary calcium creatinine ratio.

AB  - Introduction: Children <= 5 years of age with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) possibly have a distinct disease biology, data on which are scarce. We evaluated clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors of ES among children with age <= 5 years. Methods: Children with ES registered between 2003 and 2019 were included. Baseline clinical and treatment details were retrieved from medical records. Prognostic factors were identified using multivariable Cox regression. Clinical features and outcomes of children <= 5 years were compared with those greater than 5 years by chi-square and log-rank tests. Propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was done to evaluate the impact of age on survival in the metastatic and localized subgroups. Results: Out of the 859 patients, 86 (10%) were <= 5 years of age (median age 4 years, 60 males [69.8%]). The most common location was the extremities (37.2%), followed by thorax (27.9%) and head and neck (H&N) (22.1%); baseline metastases were seen in 25 patients (29.8%). The median event-free-survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 25.6 and 68.7 months, respectively. Metastatic disease predicted inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.54, p = .018) and EFS (HR = 2.47, p = .007], symptom duration <= 3 months predicted an inferior OS (HR = 2.17, p = .048). Compared to age greater than 5 years, younger children had more H&N and less pelvic primaries (p < .001) and lesser baseline metastases (p = .037). PSM analysis did not reveal any significant impact of age on OS in the metastatic (HR = 1.59, p = .29) or localized cohort (HR = 1.77, p = .09). Conclusions: Children with ES <= 5 years of age have a distinct favorable clinical presentation. However, age is not an independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes when adjusted for confounders.

AB  - Background Rare disorders comprise of similar to 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India.
   Results Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of beta-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), beta-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study.
   Conclusion The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases.

AB  - Hemoptysis in the pediatric population, while infrequent, poses significant challenges for both the family and healthcare practitioners. The severity of hemoptysis dictates management decisions. Most cases being mild and self-limiting are treated conservatively. However, "life-threatening hemoptysis" may occur, and is defined as any degree of blood loss that endangers the airway and is arbitrarily considered to be > 8 ml/kg in 24 h in children. It requires prompt airway management and resuscitation followed by a tailored approach consisting of bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), interventional radiology, and/or surgery depending on the patient 's clinical status and cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Bronchial arteries are hypertrophied in myriad conditions and account for 90-95% cases of hemoptysis due to their systemic pressure levels; the rest being contributed by pulmonary artery pathologies. Despite similar pathogenic mechanisms, the etiologies of pediatric hemoptysis differ from those in adults, with acute lower respiratory tract infections being the predominant cause. Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying the source and cause of hemorrhage. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has emerged as a prime modality in the diagnostic evaluation of hemoptysis and provides a roadmap for potential interventional procedures. This article discusses the etiopathogenesis of hemoptysis along with a brief mention of the diagnostic modalities. It provides a structured reporting format and uses it to illustrate the imaging features in hemoptysis, with emphasis on CT angiography. The key findings in the lung parenchyma, airways, bronchial and non-bronchial systemic collaterals, and pulmonary arteries are elaborated upon. It further addresses the nuances of interventional management, particularly emphasizing the applications of bronchial artery embolization and pulmonary artery embolization in the pediatric population. The article also underscores the potential complications and factors influencing recurrence rates.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) has emerged as the most common malignancy among females. The genomic profile of BC is diverse in nature and complex due to heterogeneity among various geographically different ethnic groups. The primary objective of this study was to carry out a comprehensive mutational analysis of Indian BC cases by performing whole exome sequencing. The cohort included patients with a median age of 48 years. TTN, TP53, MUC16, SYNE1, and OBSCN were the frequently altered genes found in our cohort. The PIK3CA and KLC3 genes are driver genes implicated in various cellular functions and cargo transportation through microtubules, respectively. Except for CCDC168 and PIK3CA, several gene pairings were found to be significantly linked with co-occurrence. Irrespective of their hormonal receptor status, RTK/RAS was observed with frequently altered signaling pathways. Further analysis of the mutational signature revealed that SBS13, SBS6, and SBS29 were mainly observed in our cohort. This study supplements the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and provides new therapeutic options for the improved management of BC.

AB  - BackgroundPre-vascular facial nodes (PV-FNs; perifacial lymph nodes) are supra-mandibular lymph nodes above the inferior border of the mandible. These are not part of routine neck dissection done for OCSCC. These lymph nodes can be sentinel station for metastatic lymph nodes from gingivobuccal complex cancers and are missed during routine neck dissection. It is imperative to include this sentinel station in routine neck dissection to prevent nodal recurrences.Materials and MethodsOne hundred thirty-seven patients with GBCC (T1-T4) were prospectively recruited between May 2020 and June 2022 with the intent to evaluate the incidence of PV-FN metastases and clinicopathological factors predicting them.ResultsPV-FN metastases were seen in 26 patients (18.9%; 26/137). The occult metastasis rate was 8.7% (12/137). On multivariate analysis, pathological T4 stage (pT4), LVE positivity, and intermediate-high BGS were statistically significant predictors of PV-FN metastases in our study.ConclusionsIncidence of PV-FN metastasis is high (18.9%) in GBCC, which can be potentially the first sentinel station in the lymphatic drainage pattern for this sub-site. Meticulous clearance of this nodal basin is of paramount importance during neck dissection to prevent nodal recurrences.Level of EvidenceLevel 2 (CEBM-Level of Evidence-2.1) Laryngoscope, 2024

AB  - Background and aim Bone marrow stem cells (BM-SCs) and their progeny play a central role in tissue repair and regeneration. In patients with chronic liver failure, bone marrow (BM) reserve is severally compromised and they showed marked defects in the resolution of injury and infection, leading to liver failure and the onset of decompensation. Whether BM failure is the cause or consequence of liver failure during cirrhosis is not known. In this study, we aimed to determine the underlying relationship between BM failure and regeneration failure in cirrhosis.Methodology C57Bl/6(J) mice were used to develop chronic liver injury through intra-peritoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 15 weeks (0.1-0.5 ml/kg). Animals were sacrificed to study the transition of cirrhosis and BM defects. To restore the BM-SC reserve; healthy BM cells were infused via intra-BM infusion and assessed for changes in liver injury, regeneration, and BM-SC reserve.Results Using a CCl4-induced animal - model of cirrhosis, we showed the loss of BM-SCs reserve occurred before regeneration failure and the onset of non-acute decompensation. Intra-BM infusion of healthy BM cells induced the repopulation of native hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in cirrhotic BM. Restoring BM-HSCs reserve augments liver macrophage-mediated clearance of infection and inflammation dampens neutrophil-mediated inflammation, accelerates fibrosis regression, enhances hepatocyte proliferation, and delays the onset of non-acute decompensation.Conclusion These findings suggest that loss of BM-HSCs reserve underlies the compromised innate immune function of the liver, drives regeneration failure, and the onset of non-acute decompensation. We further provide the proof-of-concept that rejuvenating BM-HSC reserve can serve as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing regeneration failure and transition to decompensated cirrhosis.

AB  - ObjectivesThe interpretation of mammograms requires many years of training and experience. Currently, training in mammography, like the rest of diagnostic radiology, is through institutional libraries, books, and experience accumulated over time. We explore whether artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated images can help in simulation education and result in measurable improvement in performance of residents in training.MethodsWe developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) that was capable of generating mammography images with varying characteristics, such as size and density, and created a tool with which a user could control these characteristics. The tool allowed the user (a radiology resident) to realistically insert cancers within different regions of the mammogram. We then provided this tool to residents in training. Residents were randomized into a practice group and a non-practice group, and the difference in performance before and after practice with such a tool (in comparison to no intervention in the non-practice group) was assessed.ResultsFifty residents participated in the study, 27 underwent simulation training, and 23 did not. There was a significant improvement in the sensitivity (7.43 percent, significant at p-value = 0.03), negative predictive value (5.05 percent, significant at p-value = 0.008) and accuracy (6.49 percent, significant at p-value = 0.01) among residents in the detection of cancer on mammograms after simulation training.ConclusionOur study shows the value of simulation training in diagnostic radiology and explores the potential of generative AI to enable such simulation training.Clinical relevance statementUsing generative artificial intelligence, simulation training modules can be developed that can help residents in training by providing them with a visual impression of a variety of different cases.Key Points.

AB  - Intracranial physiological calcifications are usually seen in Post-mortem Computed Tomography (PMCT) and are difficult to note with naked-eye examination during conventional autopsy. Studies on intracerebral calcifications in PMCT are few. Moreover, such studies may be of interest from the clinical perspective in order to compare physiological and pathological intracranial calcifications. Hence, the authors aimed to calculate the incidence of calcification of the pineal gland and choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle in brain PMCT and its association with age, sex, type of death, and manner of death. The authors studied 620 PMCT head scans of the deceased whose ages ranged from 2 months to 97 years (mean +/- SD is 38.83 +/- 15.91). A total of 59.68% had pineal calcification, and 47.42% had choroid plexus calcification with a male preponderance. A statistically significant association was present between the studied calcifications and age, sex, type of death, and manner of death. The calcification was higher in the pineal gland than in the choroid plexus until the fifth decade, and post fifth decade the choroid plexus calcification was more common. The presence of calcification was higher among the suicidal deaths when compared with the non-suicidal deaths with a statistically significant association (p < 0.05).

T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1) also known as p62, plays several important physiological roles in the cell. It regulates autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis and can further lead to metabolic reprogramming. Pathogenic variants in SQSTM1 gene are known to cause Neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy in autosomal recessive inheritance fashion. We report here, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (IGIBi010-A) carrying a novel homozygous frameshift variant in SQSTM1 i.e. p.Leu251SerfsTer4. In future, this iPSC line will be used as a resource to elucidate the molecular pathway, targeting strategies for disease biology derived by variation in SQSTM1 gene.

AB  - Introduction: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), arising from nasopharyngeal epithelium is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is common in South China, South East Asia and North East India. The aim and objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of EBV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of clinically suspected NPC patients, correlate the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with histopathology findings, and to determine the utility of tissue EBV DNA as a diagnostic bio-marker. Materials and methods: 31 FFPE tissue samples were collected from clinically suspected NPC patients from April 2018-December 2019. Histopathological diagnosis was done by examination of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides. Presence of EBV was detected by EBNA-1 PCR. IHC was performed using EBV Latent Membrane Protein 1. Results: Of the 31 clinically suspected NPC cases, 15 (48.4 %) were histopathological confirmed NPC. Of these15, 13 (86.6 %) were non-keratinising undifferentiated NPC, and one each were keratinising NPC and non-keratinising differentiated NPC respectively. EBV EBNA1 PCR was positive in 35.5 % (11/31) of clinically suspected NPC cases. Of the 11 PCR positive cases, 9 (81.8 %) were histopathological confirmed NPC. Of the 31 clinically suspected NPC cases, IHC was indicated in 23 biopsies. Of which, 12 (52.2 %) were positive for LMP1 in the abnormal cells. Of the 12 IHC positive samples, 10 were NPC cases. Conclusion: EBV DNA as an indicator towards NPC among clinically suspected cases had a sensitivity of 60 % and specificity of 87.5 %. In this study, addition of EBV DNA detection by PCR from FFPE tissue sections could confirm EBV association in 20 % of cases where it was not detected by EBV LMP1 IHC, thus helped in increasing the detection of EBV positivity in NPC cases. Early diagnosis of NPC will improve the cure rate and hence reduce the morbidity and mortality rates.

AB  - PURPOSE To evaluate the incidence of rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) in fellow eyes of patients with unilateral primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and to identify risk factors for IOP increase over long-term follow-up.<br /> METHODS The medical records of unilateral PCG patients who had completed at least 5 years of follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. The incidence of developing ocular hypertension / glaucoma in fellow eyes was analyzed. Fellow eye progressors were those which showed an increase in optic nerve cupping by at least 0.2 since the first presentation or had IOP of >21 mm Hg on two occasions. The risk factors for progression that were analyzed included IOP, visual acuity, axial length, central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal diameters (CD), presence or absence of angle dysgenesis on high-resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), and morphology of aqueous outflow pathways.<br /> RESULTS After a median follow-up of 8.2 years (range, 5-25.5) progression to bilateral disease was found in 17 of 54 patients (32%), of whom 8 (15%) developed ocular hypertension and 9 (17%) developed glaucoma in the fellow eye. Among the unaffected fellow eyes, those with a larger CD (>12 mm), measured after at least 5 years' follow-up, were ten times more likely to progress (P P = 0.01; OR = 9.5 [95% CI, 1.7-54.3]). The presence of a patent supraciliary channel was significantly more frequently associated in fellow eyes compared with affected eyes on AS-OCT (OR = 1.4 [95% CI, 0.46-4.68]).<br /> CONCLUSIONS One-third of unaffected fellow eyes of unilateral PCG eventually progress over time, most often after 5 years. Larger CD at follow-up in the fellow eye is strongly predictive for progression.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) interacting protein kinases (Mnk1 and Mnk2) mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E is an important translation initiation control, in Mnk-mediated oncogenic activity and other disease conditions. Thus, Mnk kinases are an important target for therapy. Trypanosomatids are a class of kinetoplastids, some of which are protozoan parasites and cause diseases in humans. While protein translation initiation is well understood in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, there is a lack of sufficient structural information of this process in trypanosomatids. Here, we report that trypanosomatids have one orthologue of Mnk kinase with low overall sequence homology but high homology in the kinase domain and an additional C-terminal domain containing putative calmodulin binding site(s). We show that while many of the domains and motifs are conserved, homology modeling/structure prediction, docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggest that trypanosomatid kMnk kinases, kinase domains are present in DFG-in conformation as opposed to the auto-inhibited DFD-out conformation of un-phosphorylated human Mnk1. Furthermore, we observed that several regulatory features are different in trypanosomatid kMnk kinases. Our study indicates that mechanism and regulation in the kinase domain of trypanosomatid kMnks are likely to be altered, and that they can be important drug targets.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) uses sophisticated algorithms to "learn" from large volumes of data. This could be used to optimise recruitment of blood donors through predictive modelling of future blood supply, based on previous donation and transfusion demand. We sought to assess utilisation of predictive modelling and AI blood establishments (BE) and conducted predictive modelling to illustrate its use. A BE survey of data modelling and AI was disseminated to the International Society of Blood transfusion members. Additional anonymzed data were obtained from Italy, Singapore and the United States (US) to build predictive models for each region, using January 2018 through August 2019 data to determine likelihood of donation within a prescribed number of months. Donations were from March 2020 to June 2021. Ninety ISBT members responded to the survey. Predictive modelling was used by 33 (36.7%) respondents and 12 (13.3%) reported AI use. Forty-four (48.9%) indicated their institutions do not utilise predictive modelling nor AI to predict transfusion demand or optimise donor recruitment. In the predictive modelling case study involving three sites, the most important variable for predicting donor return was number of previous donations for Italy and the US, and donation frequency for Singapore. Donation rates declined in each region during COVID-19. Throughout the observation period the predictive model was able to consistently identify those individuals who were most likely to return to donate blood. The majority of BE do not use predictive modelling and AI. The effectiveness of predictive model in determining likelihood of donor return was validated; implementation of this method could prove useful for BE operations.

AB  - The methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice is a well- established model. Our study aims to elucidate the factors influencing liver pathology in the MCD mouse model by examining physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes using histology, molecular techniques, and OMICS approaches (lipidomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a standard chow diet, a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet, or an MCD diet for 10 weeks. The MCD diet resulted in reduced body weight and fat mass, along with decreased plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels. However, it notably induced steatosis, inflammation, and alterations in gene expression associated with lipogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, and the synthesis of apolipoproteins, sphingolipids, ceramides, and carboxylesterases. Lipid analysis revealed significant changes in plasma and tissues: most ceramide non-hydroxy-sphingosine lipids significantly decreased in the liver and plasma but increased in the adipose tissue of MCD diet-fed animals. Oxidized glycerophospholipids mostly increased in the liver but decreased in the adipose tissue of the MCD diet-fed group. The gut microbiome of the MCD diet-fed group showed an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated that the MCD diet significantly altered amino acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism pathways in plasma, liver, fecal, and cecal samples. LC-MS data indicated higher total plasma bile acid intensity and reduced fecal glycohyodeoxycholic acid intensity in the MCD diet group. This study demonstrates that although the MCD diet induces hepatic steatosis, the mechanisms underlying NASH in this model differ from those in human NASH pathology.

AB  - Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) derived from tRNAs are known as tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). These tsRNAs are further categorized into tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and tRNA halves (tiRNAs), which play significant roles in the various molecular mechanisms underlying certain human diseases. However, the generation of tsRNAs and their potential roles during Dengue virus (DENV) infection is not yet known. Here, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify the generation and alterations in tsRNAs expression profiles of DENV-infected Huh7 cells. Upon DENV infection, tRNA fragmentation was found to be increased. We identified a significant number of differentially expressed tsRNAs during DENV infection. Interestingly, the 3 ' tRF population showed upregulation, while the i-tRF population exhibited downregulation. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed to analyze the impact of differentially expressed tsRNAs on DENV pathogenesis. Our results suggest that differentially expressed tsRNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation via RNA polymerase II promoter and metabolic pathways. Overall, our study contributes significantly to our understanding of the roles played by tsRNAs in the complex dynamics of DENV infection.

AB  - Objective: There is limited information on population-specific norms of trabecular-bone-score (TBS) and its associated factors. Here, we provide norms of TBS in Asian-Indians and its relationship with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and intact-parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Participants and Measurements: TBS, bone-mineral-density (BMD), and vertebral-fractures (VFs) were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 923 healthy Asian-Indians (aged 20-60 years). Serum 25(OH)D, iPTH, T4/TSH,, glycosylated-haemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured and associations with TBS assessed using multivariable linear regression. Subjects with BMD Z-score <= -2.0 or >= 2.0 at any sites, VFs, TSH > 10.0 or <0.05 <mu>IU/ml, blood-glucose >11.1 mmol/L or HbA1c > 8.0% were excluded for generating Asian-Indian norms. Results: TBS norms were generated in 744 healthy Asian-Indians (M:F,389:385). The cut-offs generated for 'normal', 'partially-degraded', and 'degraded' TBS were <bold>></bold>1.305, 1.204-1.305 and <1.204, respectively. Mean TBS was lower in females than males (p < .001). There was 75% congruency in TBS categories between Asian-Indian and existing norms. Specificity (97.8 vs. 77.9%, p < .001) and diagnostic-accuracy (97.8% vs. 78.4%, p < .001) of TBS to detect osteoporosis were higher with Asian-Indian norms. The sensitivity of 'partially-degraded' TBS to diagnose osteopenia was also higher with Asian-Indian norms. In multivariable regression, gender, body-mass-index (BMI), BMD-L-1-L-4, serum PTH, daily dietary-calorie intake and calcium intake were associated with TBS. Though 25(OH)D inversely correlated with PTH, 25(OH)D was not associated with TBS. Conclusion: This study provides norms for TBS in Asian-Indians with gender-specific differences. Increasing age and higher BMI were associated with lower TBS. Associations of TBS with circulating PTH and/or 25(OH)D need confirmation in further studies.

Methods: 128 channel EEG was recorded in sixty subjects (30, with alcohol, opioid and internet addiction; 30 controls) during rest and while performing working memory task to ascertain underlying differences in cortical activity between the groups while at rest and during performance of the task. Artifactually clean data was then subjected to source analysis using sLORETA software in both the groups. Results: EEG cortical source analysis in subjects with addictive disorders showed significant activation of areas of Default Mode Network (DMN) and reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), an area known to be involved in executive function, during performance of task. However, control subjects demonstrated significantly reduced activation in areas of DMN; and increased activation of DLPFC during task performance. Conclusion: Inability to suppress DMN inhibits reallocation of neural resources to areas of executive functioning leading to working memory deficits in subjects with addictive disorder.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the clinico-pathological features, management and outcomes, amongst extracranial malignant germ cell tumors (MGCTs) in children treated primarily at a tertiary care center in a resource-challenged nation.MethodsThe prospectively maintained data for children below 14 y of age treated for extracranial MGCT from May 1994 to January 2023 was analyzed for patient characteristics, management, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) and factors effecting survival. Events was defined as death, recurrence and progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently predicting unfavorable outcomes.ResultsOne hundred and seventy-seven children (37% males) with a median (IQR) age at presentation of 30 mo (range 2-168 mo) were included. The cohort consisted of 87 (49%) extra-gonadal and 90 (51%) gonadal cases. Disease was metastatic at presentation in 48 (27%) with lungs being the most common site. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was given to 119 (67%) and finally 162/177 (92%) had undergone resection of the primary tumor. Endodermal sinus tumor (EST) was the commonest histological subtype in 141 children (73%). Twenty-two (12%) patients had died giving a 5-y OS of 84.7% (95% CI 78.3- 91.1). Recurrence occurred in 25 patients, and an additional 5 patients had progression giving a 5-y EFS of 69.9% (95% CI 62.5- 77.3). Stage III (p = 0.05), Stage IV (p = 0.006) and extra-gonadal site (p = 0.05) were significantly associated with poorer EFS.ConclusionsChildren with MGCT have a favorable outcome with 5-y OS of 84.7% and EFS of 69.9%. Stage III and IV disease and extra-gonadal sites were independent predictors of a poor outcome.

AB  - Native T1 mapping is a non-invasive technique used for early detection of diffused myocardial abnormalities, and it provides baseline tissue characterization. Post-contrast T1 mapping enhances tissue differentiation, enables extracellular volume (ECV) calculation, and improves myocardial viability assessment. Accurate and precise segmenting of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium on T1 maps is crucial for assessing myocardial tissue characteristics and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study presents a deep learning (DL)-based pipeline for automatically segmenting LV myocardium on T1 maps and automatic computation of radial T1 and ECV values. The study employs a multicentric dataset consisting of retrospective multiparametric MRI data of 332 subjects to develop and assess the performance of the proposed method. The study compared DL architectures U-Net and Deep Res U-Net for LV myocardium segmentation, which achieved a dice similarity coefficient of 0.84 +/- 0.43 and 0.85 +/- 0.03, respectively. The dice similarity coefficients computed for radial sub-segmentation of the LV myocardium on basal, mid-cavity, and apical slices were 0.77 +/- 0.21, 0.81 +/- 0.17, and 0.61 +/- 0.14, respectively. The t-test performed between ground truth vs. predicted values of native T1, post-contrast T1, and ECV showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) for any of the radial sub-segments. The proposed DL method leverages the use of quantitative T1 maps for automatic LV myocardium segmentation and accurately computing radial T1 and ECV values, highlighting its potential for assisting radiologists in objective cardiac assessment and, hence, in CVD diagnostics.

AB  - Recent studies report the overall incidence of distal femur fractures as 8.7/100,000/year. This incidence is expected to rise with high energy motor vehicle collisions and elderly osteoporotic fractures in native and prosthetic knees keep increasing. These fractures are more common in males in the younger age spectrum while females predominate for elderly osteoporotic fractures. Surgical treatment is recommended for these fractures to maintain articular congruity, enable early joint motion and assisted ambulation. Over the last two decades, development of minimally invasive and quadriceps sparing surgical approaches, availability of angle stable implants have helped achieve predictable healing and early return to function in these patients. Currently, laterally positioned locked plate is the implant of choice across all fracture patterns. Retrograde with capital implantation of intramedullary nails with provision for multiplanar distal locking is preferred for extra-articular and partial articular fractures. Even with these advancements, nonunion after distal femur fracture fixation can be as high as 19%. Further recent research has helped us understand the biomechanical limitations and healing problems with lateral locked plate fixation and intramedullary nails. This has lead to development of more robust constructs such as nail-plate and double plate constructs aiming for improved construct strength and to minimise failures. Early results with these combination constructs have shown promise in high risk situations such as fractures with extensive metaphyseal fragmentation, osteoporosis and periprosthetic fractures. These constructs however, run the risk of being over stiff and can inhibit healing if not kept balanced. The ideal stiffness that is needed for fracture healing is not clearly known and current research in this domain has lead to the development of smart implants which are expected to evolve and may help improve clinical results in future.

AB  - PurposeThe saphenous nerve is a predominantly sensory nerve. It is the longest nerve of the body which supplies the skin of the medial side of the leg and foot as far as the ball of the great toe. We present here an unusual motor branch of the saphenous nerve to the sartorius muscle.MethodInstitutional guidelines for use of human cadaver were followed. Routine dissection of the lower limbs for undergraduate medical teaching was performed in a 67 years old female cadaver employing standard methods. Relevant gross features of the variations were photographed. H&E staining of relevant structure was done and photomicrographed.ResultsThe unusual motor branch to Sartorius was observed in the right thigh. The branch was given off in the lower third of the thigh after the saphenous nerve exited the adductor canal. The branch was distinctly seen entering the substance of the sartorius. The structure was confirmed to be a peripheral nerve by histological examination. The saphenous nerve then descended between the sartorius and gracilis tendons, pierced the fascia lata and became cutaneous.ConclusionThe motor branch to the sartorius muscle is a very rare branch whose knowledge is important for clinicians as it can get damaged during arthroscopy and other knee surgery or during adductor canal block.

AB  - BackgroundThe associations of vegetarian diets with risks for site-specific cancers have not been estimated reliably due to the low number of vegetarians in previous studies. Therefore, the Cancer Risk in Vegetarians Consortium was established. The aim is to describe and compare the baseline characteristics between non-vegetarian and vegetarian diet groups and between the collaborating studies.MethodsWe harmonised individual-level data from 11 prospective cohort studies from Western Europe, North America, South Asia and East Asia. Comparisons of food intakes, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were made between diet groups and between cohorts using descriptive statistics.Results2.3 million participants were included; 66% women and 34% men, with mean ages at recruitment of 57 (SD: 7.8) and 57 (8.6) years, respectively. There were 2.1 million meat eaters, 60,903 poultry eaters, 44,780 pescatarians, 81,165 vegetarians, and 14,167 vegans. Food intake differences between the diet groups varied across the cohorts; for example, fruit and vegetable intakes were generally higher in vegetarians than in meat eaters in all the cohorts except in China. BMI was generally lower in vegetarians, particularly vegans, except for the cohorts in India and China. In general, but with some exceptions, vegetarians were also more likely to be highly educated and physically active and less likely to smoke. In the available resurveys, stability of diet groups was high in all the cohorts except in China.ConclusionsFood intakes and lifestyle factors of both non-vegetarians and vegetarians varied markedly across the individual cohorts, which may be due to differences in both culture and socioeconomic status, as well as differences in questionnaire design. Therefore, care is needed in the interpretation of the impacts of vegetarian diets on cancer risk.

AB  - Introduction: Associations between markers of impaired kidney function and adverse outcomes among South Asians is understudied and could differ from existing data derived mostly from North American or European cohorts. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 9797 participants from the ongoing cardiometabolic risk reduction study in South Asia, India. We examined the associations between baseline spot urine albumin-to-creatinine (UACR) ratio and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimating equations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for baseline age, sex, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, tobacco, history of cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol. Additionally, we calculated population attributable fraction (PAF) for both markers. Results: Over a median 7-year follow-up, with 66,909 person-years, 791 deaths occurred. At baseline, the weighted prevalence of UACR >= 30 mg/g and eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was 6.6% and 1.6%, respectively. The risk for mortality was increased with higher UACR (10-30 hazard ratio [HR]: 1.6 [1.2-2.1]), 30-300 HR: 2.4 [1.8-3.1]), and >= 300 (HR: 6.0 [3.8-9.4] relative to UACR <10 mg/g). Risk for mortality was also higher with lower eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) (44-30; HR: 4.5 [2.5-8.3] and <30 HR: 7.0 [3.7-13.0], relative to 90-104 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). PAF for mortality because of UACR >= 30 mg/g and eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were 24.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Single-time point assessment of UACR >= 30 mg/g or eGFR(CKD-EPI 2009) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) portends higher mortality risk among urban South Asians. Because albuminuria is common and associated with accelerated decline in GFR, screening and targeted efforts to reduce albuminuria are warranted.

AB  - The global demographic and epidemiological transition have led to a rapidly increasing burden of cancer, particularly among older adults. There are scant data on the prevalence and demographic pattern of cancer in older Indian persons. This was a multicentric observational study conducted between January 2019 and December 2020. Data were retrieved from existing electronic databases to gather information on two key variables: the total number of patients registered with oncologists and the number of patients aged 60 years and above. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of older adults among patients with cancer served by these hospitals. Secondary objectives included understanding the prevalence of different types of cancer in the older population, and the sex- and geographic distribution of cancer in older Indian patients. We included 272,488 patients with cancer from 17 institutes across India. Among them, 97,962 individuals (36 %) were aged 60 years and above. The proportion of older adults varied between 20.6 % and 53.6 % across the participating institutes. The median age of the older patients with cancer was 67 (interquartile range, 63-72) years. Of the 54,281 patients for whom the details regarding sex were available, 32,243 (59.4 %) were male. Of the 56,903 older patients, head and neck malignancies were the most prevalent, accounting for 11,158 cases (19.6 %), followed by breast cancer (6260 cases, 11 %), genitourinary cancers (6242 cases, 10.9 %), lung cancers (6082 cases, 10.7 %), hepatopancreaticobiliary (6074, 10.7 %), and hematological malignancies (5226 cases, 9.2 %). Over one-third of Indian patients with cancer are aged 60 years and above, with a male predominance. Head and neck, breast, and genitourinary cancers are the most prevalent in this age group. Characterizing the burden of cancer in older adults is crucial to enable tailored interventions and additional research to improve the care and support for this vulnerable population.

AB  - Context:Concerns about brolucizumab's (Pagenax (R)) association with intraocular inflammation (IOI) limit its use despite its cost-effectiveness and efficacy. This multicentric study analyzes IOI incidence across 21 tertiary eyecare centers in India since its introduction in October 2020.Purpose:To determine the real-world incidence rate of IOI in Indian patients secondary to intravitreal brolucizumab across 21 tertiary eye care centers in India.Settings and Design:Retrospective multicentric, survey-based study.Methods:Data including number of patients treated, clinical indications, side effects encountered, and IOI case details was collected via Google Forms in 21 Indian tertiary eye care centers since October 2020. Mean, median, frequency, and standard deviation were calculated for statistical analysis.Results:All centers used pro re nata protocol for brolucizumab injections with a minimum injection interval of 8 weeks. The incidence of IOI was 0.79% (21 events out of 2655 eyes). Treatment indications included idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and off-label uses. IOI was experienced after the first injection (57%) in majority of cases with a median onset of 14 days (range: 1-65 days). IOI was mild in 28.5%, moderate in 33%, and severe in 38% of cases. Eighteen out of 21 IOI eyes recovered preinjection best corrected visual acuity or better.Conclusions:Our study found a lower IOI incidence (0.79%) with brolucizumab (Pagenax) in Indian patients compared to previously reported literature. IOI events were mostly mild to moderate, and post-treatment, most patients improved or maintained BCVA. Larger prospective multicentric studies with PRN dosing protocol are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The recently re-emerged mpox (monkeypox) virus that causes mpox disease is a member of genus Orthopoxvirus and has unprecedentedly spread worldwide. Numerous studies have contributed to our understanding of its evolution, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations. The current outbreak of the mpox virus depicts its novel route of transmission as a new variant. However, the exact reason for its transition from an epidemic to a pandemic remains unclear. Furthermore, other poxviruses such as vaccinia virus, variola virus, and cowpox virus, also belong to the same genus, Orthopoxvirus. In the present review, our objective was to summarize the evidence on evolution, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of mpox virus and its related poxviruses. The present review would aid in a better understanding of the current circulating mpox virus and its differences from other poxviruses. In addition, the shared genetic factors contributing to virulence in these Orthopoxvirus highlight their evolutionary connections and genetic similarities. While they exhibit differences in virulence, studying these genetic relationships is crucial for understanding their biology, pathogenicity, and the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapeutics to curb mpox disease.

AB  - Emerging evidence shows increased humoral response post-omicron surge, but research on T cell responses is limited. This study investigated the durability, magnitude, and breadth of SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific T cell responses in 216 two-dose vaccinated individuals pre- and post-omicron surge. Post-surge samples showed enhanced T cell responses, indicating widespread asymptomatic exposure to omicron. Further analysis of 105 individuals with multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 through boosters or infections showed that post-omicron, two-dose vaccinated individuals had T cell responses comparable to those of COVID-19 convalescents or boosted individuals. Additionally, we report cross-reactive T cell responses against omicron sub-variants, including BA2.86, remained strong, with preserved frequencies of spike-specific stem-cell-like memory T cells. In silico prediction indicates that mutated epitopes of JN.1 and KP.2 retain over 95.6% of their HLA binding capability. Overall, our data suggests that T cell responses are sustained, enhanced, and cross-reactive against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants following symptomatic or asymptomatic omicron infection.

AB  - The escalating global threat of climate change is becoming more evident. The climate crisis intersects with another major challenge: lung cancer. With Asia already bearing half the global cancer burden, the impact of climate-related events on health and on lung cancer care specifically are profound. There can potentially be critical implications on the overall landscape of lung cancer care-from screening and early detection, to management and treatment. In 2022, the deadliest flooding events occurred in India and Pakistan. Extreme weather events such as cyclones and typhoons cause damage to healthcare facilities and disrupt transportation networks. These impede access to vital treatments, causing delays, thus worsening patients' conditions. Most low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have disparities in healthcare infrastructure, resources, and workforce distribution that result in limited access to comprehensive care. This fragmented healthcare system in many Asian countries pose additional challenges. Adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial for minimizing these impacts on cancer care. Addressing this complex interplay demands urgent, collaborative, and multidisciplinary efforts to safeguard healthcare and ensure access to uninterrupted care amid climate-related challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of surveys have analyzed the impact virus spreading on the everyday medical practice, including neurosurgery. However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time.
   METHODS: From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed.
   RESULTS: Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved. Financial concerns overshadow mental health.

AB  - Objective: We determined whether endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET) is associated with better health-related quality of life (QoL) compared with open thyroidectomy.
   Methods: We randomly assigned 28 patients aged older than 18 years, Bethesda IV or less on cytology and gland volume of <40 mL to undergo hemithyroidectomy through either open or endoscopic (axillo-breast approach/bilateral axillo-breast approach) technique. The primary outcome was QoL scores on the Short Form-36 and Thyroid-Specific Questionnaire at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postsurgery. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications, hospital stay, and pain scores.
   Results: The generic QoL scores based on Short Form-36 were statistically nonsignificant between the two groups. QoL scores based on Thyroid-Specific Questionnaire were statistically significant (P < 0.05) favoring open thyroidectomy in the following domains: (1) numbness at 2, 6, and 12 weeks (P = 0.04, 0.004, and 0.005, respectively), (2) shoulder impairment at 2 weeks (P = 0.017), and (3) favoring ET in cosmesis at 6 and 12 weeks (P = 0.037 and 0.02, respectively). ET has longer operative time (104.6 +/- 25.4 vs 123 +/- 8.9 min; P = 0.03), longer hospital stays (2.8 +/- 0.4 vs 2.4 +/- 0.5; P = 0.056) and higher pain scores at 2 and 6 weeks (P = 0.007 and 0.012, respectively) but decreased intraoperative bleeding (33.5 +/- 6.4 vs 29.1 +/- 3.7 mL; P = 0.037).
   Conclusion: ET has higher cosmetic satisfaction, increased numbness, and shoulder movement impairment during short-term postsurgery follow-up. Both techniques are similar in impacting general physical, mental, and social health-related QoL.

AB  - Aim This study aimed to evaluate the potential role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in providing a targeted approach for diagnosing the etiology of Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). Methods A total of 573 PUO patients were included in this ambispective study, with a mean age of 39.40 +/- 4.6 years. Patients underwent FDG PET/CT scans using dedicated hybrid scanners. PET/CT data were interpreted by experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The study analyzed the guidance provided by FDG PET/CT for appropriate biopsy sites and assessed concordance between PET/CT findings and histopathological examination. Results Out of the 573 patients, a final diagnosis was reached for 219 patients, including malignancy, infectious causes, noninfectious inflammatory causes (NIID), and precancerous conditions. FDG PET/CT played a crucial role in guiding clinicians to appropriate biopsy sites, contributing to a higher diagnostic yield. Concordance between PET/CT findings and histopathological examination emphasized the noninvasive diagnostic potential of PET/CT in identifying underlying causes of PUO. Overall, FDG PET/CT contributed to guiding the appropriate site of biopsy or concordance of the first differential diagnosis with the final diagnosis in 50.05% of cases. Conclusion This study highlights the valuable role of FDG PET/CT in providing a targeted approach for diagnosing PUO, showcasing its potential in guiding clinicians towards appropriate biopsy sites and improving the diagnostic yield. The findings underscore the importance of integrating FDG PET/CT into the diagnostic pathway for PUO, ultimately enhancing patient management and outcomes. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these results and refine the integration of FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of PUO. Copyright (c) 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, concerns over its safety in terms of nerve injury and postoperative voice changes remain. This prospective study evaluated the role of vocal cord function assessment using laryngeal examination and voice analysis in patients who underwent endoscopic hemithyroidectomy either by the trans-oral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) or the bilateral axillobreast approach (BABA).Methods:Thirty-nine consecutive patients were randomly allocated to either of the 2 groups of endoscopic hemithyroidectomy; 19 in TOETVA and 20 in the BABA groups. Vocal cord function was assessed subjectively using the GRBAS scale and objectively by acoustic analysis of parameters such as jitter, shimmer, mean frequency (F0), noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), and maximum phonatory time (MPT) at baseline, postoperative day 10, and 3 months after surgery.Results:There were no significant differences in mean GRBAS scores and values of mean frequency, jitter and shimmer between the 2 groups and on postoperative day 10 and at 3 months compared with baseline. The mean NHR and MPT showed no differences between the 2 procedures. However, there was a significant decrease in their values on day 10 postsurgery, compared with baseline. These values returned to their baseline at 3 months. The other operative parameters were comparable between the 2 groups, except for the shorter mean operative time in the TOETVA group.Conclusions:Perioperative quantitative voice parameters were comparable with no statistically significant difference between the 2 techniques of endoscopic thyroidectomy.

AB  - ObjectivesTo compare the efficacy and safety of RAM cannula with short binasal prongs (SBPs) as nasal interfaces in preterm infants requiring nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).MethodsThe authors searched electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Web of Science) and trial registries from inception until March 15, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the RAM cannula with SBP for delivering nCPAP/NIPPV. They performed a random-effects meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4 software. The primary outcome was failure of nCPAP/NIPPV. Secondary outcomes included nasal injury, mechanical ventilation, air leaks, and mortality.ResultsFive RCTs (825 participants) were included. There was no significant difference in nCPAP/NIPPV failure (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.87) or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.23; 95% CI: 0.75 to 2.01) between the RAM cannula and SBP groups (low to very low certainty). Compared with infants in the SBP group, those in the RAM cannula group had a significantly lower incidence of moderate to severe nasal injury [(5 RCTs, 825 participants; RR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.66); low certainty] and any nasal injury [(RR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.76; very low certainty)]. There was no significant difference in the other clinical outcomes.ConclusionsIn comparison to SBP, the RAM cannula may have little to no effect on nCPAP/NIPPV failure, but the evidence is very uncertain. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the use of RAM cannula possibly results in reduction in moderate to severe nasal trauma in preterm infants receiving nCPAP/NIPPV.

AB  - BackgroundWhile previously considered a transient condition, with no lasting adverse impact, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is now a well-established risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The risk of developing T2DM appears to be particularly high in the first few years after childbirth, providing a compelling case for early intervention. This review provides an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce incidence of T2DM in women with a recent history of GDM.MethodsThe search was conducted on October 20, 2023 with an annual surveillance planned for the next 5 years to maintain a living systematic review. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of any type in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy that reported outcomes of T2DM diagnosis or measures of dysglycemia with a follow-up of at least 12 months.ResultsSeventeen studies met our inclusion criteria and have been included in this review. There were 3 pharmacological and 14 lifestyle interventions. Intervention was not associated with significant reduction in the primary outcome of T2DM (risk ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-1.41; p = 0.41; I2 = 79%) compared with the control group (placebo or usual care). However, meta-analysis of the four studies reporting hazard ratios suggested a reduction in diabetes incidence (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.97; p = 0.03; I2 = 31%).ConclusionThis review provides equivocal evidence about the efficacy of interventions to reduce the risk of T2DM in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy and highlights the need for further studies, including pharmacotherapy. imageConclusionThis review provides equivocal evidence about the efficacy of interventions to reduce the risk of T2DM in women within 5 years of GDM-complicated pregnancy and highlights the need for further studies, including pharmacotherapy. image

AB  - Non-tumorous kidney diseases include a variety of conditions affecting both the structure and function of the kidneys, thereby causing a range of health-related problems. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as a potential diagnostic tool, offering a multifaceted approach to evaluating non-tumorous kidney diseases. Its clinical significance extends beyond its conventional role in cancer imaging, enabling a comprehensive assessment of renal structure and function. This review explores the diverse applications of PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of non-cancerous kidney diseases. It examines PET/CT's role in assessing acute kidney injuries, including acute pyelonephritis and other forms of nephritis, as well as chronic conditions such as immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the review delves into PET/CT's utility in evaluating complications in renal transplant recipients, identifying renal histiocytosis and detecting renal amyloidosis. The current review aims to promote further research and technological advancements to popularize PET/CT's clinical utility in diagnosing and treating non-tumorous kidney diseases.

AB  - Context.-ALK - ALK and ROS1 rearrangements are essential biomarkers to be tested in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. While D5F3 Ventana assay is a companion diagnostic for anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeted - targeted therapy, immunohistochemistry is only a screening tool for detecting ROS1 rearrangement. Confirmation by cytogenetic or molecular techniques is necessary. Objective.-To - To evaluate the utility of ALK and ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization as a complement to immunohistochemistry in routine predictive biomarker testing algorithms. Design.-The study was ambispective, spanning 4.5 years during which lung adenocarcinoma samples were subjected to EGFR mutation testing by real-time polymerase chain reaction and ALK/ROS1 rearrangement testing by immunohistochemistry (Ventana D5F3 assay for anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein; manual assay with D4D6 clone for Ros proto-oncogene 1 protein). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in all anaplastic lymphoma kinase equivocal and Ros protooncogene 1 immunopositive cases. Results.- Of 1874 samples included, EGFR mutations were detected in 27% (481 of 1796). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunohistochemistry was positive in 10% (174 of 1719) and equivocal in 3% (58 of 1719) of samples tested. ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization showed 81% (77 of 95) concordance with immunohistochemistry. Ros protooncogene 1 immunopositivity was noted in 13% (190 of 1425) of cases, with hybridization-confirmed rearrangements in 19.3% (26 of 135) of samples, all of which showed diffuse, strong- to moderate-intensity, cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. Ros proto-oncogene 1 protein overexpression without rearrangement was significantly common in EGFR-- mutant and ALK-rearranged adenocarcinomas. Conclusions. - Immunostaining is a robust method for ALK-- rearrangement testing, with fluorescence in situ hybridization adding value in the rare equivocal stained case. ROS1- rearrangement testing is more cost-effective if immunohistochemistry is followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization after excluding EGFR-mutant and ALK-rearranged adenocarcinomas.

AB  - Antifungal drug resistance in filamentous fungi, particularly Aspergillus species, is increasing worldwide. Therefore, new antifungal drugs or combinations of drugs are urgently required to overcome this public health situation. In the present study, we examined the antifungal activity of vancomycin-functionalized AuNPs. These functionalized AuNPs were characterized, and their antifungal activity and associated killing mechanism were investigated using conventional methodologies against the conidia of A. fumigatus and A. flavus. The differential antifungal activity of vancomycin-functionalized Au-NPs against the conidia of Aspergillus species is dependent on structural differences in the conidial cell wall. The results demonstrated potent fungicidal activity against A. fumigatus, with a MIC value of 4.68 mu g/mL, 93% germination inhibition, and 38.4% killing rate within 8 h of exposure. However, the activity against A. flavus was fungistatic; a MIC value of 18.7 mu g/mL and 35% conidial germination inhibition, followed by 28.4% killing rate, were noted under similar conditions. Furthermore, endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was 37.4 and 23.1% in conidial populations of A. fumigatus and A. flavus, respectively. Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the possible (but not confirmed) binding of functionalized AuNPs with the chitin and galactomannan components of the cell wall. A potential strategy that involves the exploration of antibacterial drugs using AuNPs as efficient drug carriers may also be appropriate for countering emerging drug resistance in filamentous fungi.

AB  - BackgroundIn this substudy of the Value of Gated-SPECT MPI for Ischemia- Guided PCI of non-culprit vessels in STEMI Patients with Multi vessel Disease after primary PCI trial after primary PCI we aim to assess if infarct size affects conventional measures of dyssynchrony at rest. Additionally, we explore if there is an independent correlation of stress-inducible ischemia with dyssynchrony at rest.MethodsThe 48 patients with imaging at randomization were analyzed. Gated-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI with vasodilator stress and technetium-99m-labeled tracers was performed. The phase histogram bandwidth (HBW), phase SD, and entropy were obtained with the QGS software. Correlation between dyssynchrony at rest and infarct size and inducible ischemia was performed using the Spearman test.ResultsAccording to normal database limits dyssynchrony parameters at rest were abnormal for men. In women only HBW was abnormal. Correlation between the summed rest score with dyssynchrony was significant only for entropy (P = 0.035). No correlation was observed for dyssynchrony and stress-induced ischemia.ConclusionEntropy, as a measure of dyssynchrony, has potential in the assessment of patients with STEMI and multivessel disease after primary PCI. Smaller residual myocardial scars in PCI-reperfused patients with STEMI may contribute to the lack of correlation between dyssynchrony at rest and infarct size and stress-induced ischemia, respectively.

AB  - Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, is prescribed as maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with MM receiving lenalidomide were found to develop a distinct therapy-related B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the molecular mechanism by which lenalidomide drives B-ALL is unknown. We show that thalidomide treatment of B cell lines increased CD34 expression and fi bronectin adhesion. This resembled the effects of Ikzf1 loss of function mutations in B-ALL. IKZF1 is a transcription factor that can act as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor depending upon the target loci. In our experiments, thalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF1 increased the expression of its transcriptional repression targets Itga5 and CD34 explaining the increased adhesion and stemness. Strikingly, withdrawal of thalidomide lead to the mis-localization of IKZF1 to the cytoplasm. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation data showed a long-term effect of thalidomide treatment on IKZF1 target loci. This included decreased chromatin occupancy at early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) and Spi1 (PU.1). Consequently, B-cell lineage specifying transcription factors including Pax5, Spi1 and EBF1 were downregulated even after 7 days of thalidomide withdrawal. Our study thus provides a molecular mechanism of thalidomide-induced BALL whereby thalidomide alters the chromatin occupancy of IKZF1 at key B-cell lineage transcription factors leading to a persistent block in B-cell differentiation.

Tumor tissues and control tissues were analyzed for MUC4 and other mucins through immunohistochemistry.ResultMUC4 expression in tumor tissue was found to be significantly elevated in PDAC patients as compared with chronic pancreatitis tissues and normal pancreatic tissues. Periampullary carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma tissue also showed increased expression of MUC4 and other mucins.ConclusionsDifferential expression of MUC4 in pancreatic tumor tissues can help to differentiate PDAC from benign conditions.

AB  - Background & objectives: Timely detection of population with beta-thalassemia trait (BTT) followed by genetic counselling is an advocated method of preventing the birth of a child with beta-thalassemia major. In this study we aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle, a point-of-care (POC) testing device, in screening for BTT in hospital laboratory setting. Methods: Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines were followed in developing study design, recruiting study participants and sample size calculation for the current research. A consecutive sample of 446 participants was recruited for this study and was tested for the reference test Gazelle as well as the gold standard cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (CE-HPLC). Low serum ferritin levels are known to interfere with the production of HbA2 and in turn lead to false negative results. Hence, the study population was divided into two categories with respect to a cut off value of 15ng/dl of serum ferritin and the results were analyzed. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle for detecting BTT was found to be 95.3 per cent with a confidence interval (CI) of (92.9 - 97.1) and the sensitivity was 94.5 per cent with a 95% CI of (84.8 - 98.8). When analyzed by the serum ferritin level the diagnostic accuracy was found to be 94.7 per cent (91.1% - 97.1%) and 95.7 per cent (91.8% - 98.1%) for participants with serum ferritin level as > 15 ng/ml and < 15 ng/ml, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: This study found Gazelle to be a good screening tool for beta-thalassemia trait with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However, it is recommended that the final confirmation of the diagnosis done by a diagnostic test like HPLC or Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE).

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the visual outcome of mini-scleral contact lenses (MSLs) in keratoconus following the resolution of acute hydrops. Methods: This was a prospective observational case series of patients of healed hydrops in keratoconus fitted with an MSL (Keracare, Acculens, Lakewood, CO) who were managed for acute hydrops medically or surgically at least 3 months prior. Uncorrected visual acuity, best spectacles-corrected visual acuity, best lens-corrected visual acuity, topographic indices, keratometric indices, contact lens parameters, and ocular aberrometric changes were evaluated. All patients were followed up for at least 3 months. Results: Eighteen eyes of 17 patients were included in the analysis. The mean post-hydrops topographic values of the eyes included flat keratometric value (K1) 64.93 +/- 10.88 (range 44.30-93.40) diopters (D), steep keratometric value (K2) 70.41 +/- 10.92 D (range 45.8-98.6 D), and Kmax of 79.53 +/- 17.73 D (range 50-130.2). The final mini-scleral lens's mean dioptric power was -8.56 +/- 3.96 D (range -18 to -4). Visual acuity significantly improved from post-hydrops resolution uncorrected visual acuity of 1.5 +/- 0.71 logMAR to 0.79 +/- 0.18 logMAR best spectacles-corrected visual acuity to 0.27 +/- 0.01 logMAR best lens-corrected visual acuity (P-value <0.0001). Similarly, there was considerable improvement in corneal aberrometric values after wearing an MSL. At the 3-month follow-up, 15 patients (16 eyes) were compliant to contact lens use with a minimum of 6 to 8 hr daily while two patients (2 eyes) were poorly compliant. Conclusions: A MSL is a valuable option for visual rehabilitation in keratoconus following the resolution of acute hydrops.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychophysical understanding of a slip stimulus applied at the fingertips. We hypothesized that the perception of slip and its characteristics, such as slip distance and slip speed depends on the interaction between slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed. We developed a novel slip induction device to simulate the artificial sense of slip for prehensile grasps. We conducted a psychophysical experiment on eight healthy subjects. The experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of slip direction on slip perception as well as on the perception of slip distance and slip speed. A series of psychophysical questions were asked at the end of the slip stimulus to record the subjective responses of the participants. The average perceptual accuracy (PA) (%) was used to quantify the subject responses. We showed that the perception of slip during a prehensile grasp is independent of slip direction, but slip direction significantly modulates the perception of slip distance and slip speed. We also observed that a significant interaction exists between slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. It was also observed that the average PA was significantly different for various combinations of slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. This study clearly establishes an interaction between the slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed for prehensile grasps. Our findings may have a direct impact on grip function assessment and rehabilitation for individuals with sensorimotor deficits.

AB  - In India, adult neurosurgeons are required to care for children regularly because the concept of dedicated pediatric specialty care is not yet entirely established in the subcontinent. Likewise, pediatric neurosurgeons do not exclusively offer their services to the young, but they also provide care to adult patients with neurosurgical disorders. This creates a medical system where the transition between specialties is not often a formal and recognized aspect of neurosurgical care because most neurosurgeons provide care for patients of all ages. Additionally, there are very few teams geared toward caring for conditions in children that merit lifelong medical support, with spina bifida (SB) being one of them. Since there are no focused or structured pediatric programs on a large scale, developing a multidisciplinary clinic for adults becomes challenging. A pragmatic approach using technology-based education, supported by an organized system or a coordinator, may be a new strategy. A new system utilizing telemedicine and smartphones for established patients maybe an alternative option for SB children in India. During virtual video conferences, an established patient may benefit from multispecialty care and education toward a smooth transition that avoids significant issues with time, transportation, or financial constraints. Achieving a seamless transition among allied specialists from the pediatric to adult systems is a utopia. The current system in the subcontinent may be improved, with an opportunity to develop smooth transition care between coordinated specialists (who simultaneously treat children and adults). Learning from various global SB management styles, the Indian transition situation may offer another model in the near future.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to examine the sources of stress among first-year medical students; the frequency of their coping strategies; the factors associated with specific stressors and specific coping strategies adopted by the participants.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with 409 first-year students at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam. The Vietnamese versions of the Higher Education Stress Inventory (V_HESI) and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (V_Brief COPE) were validated and were used as measurement instruments for participants' sources of stress and coping strategies frequencies. The survey comprised questions of socioeconomic status, stress-related issues, the six sources of stress (using the V_HESI), and the nine coping strategies (using the V_Brief COPE).Results Among the six sources of stress, "Worries about future competence/endurance" had the highest mean score (3.02 +/- 0.64), while "Mismatch in professional role expectations" had the lowest score (1.60 +/- 0.53). "Financial concerns" and "Academic workloads" were also significant sources of stress. Regarding coping strategies, Self-distraction was most frequently adopted by the participants (2.80 +/- 0.68). Problem-solving (2.72 +/- 0.53) and seeking Social support (2.62 +/- 0.70) were also common adaptive strategies. Avoidance (1.87 +/- 0.55) and substance-use (1.27 +/- 0.55) were the least frequent strategies. Students who experienced acute stress event were more likely to have financial concerns compared to others. Substance use was positively associated with stressors from "Mismatch in professional role expectations", "Non-supportive educational environment", "Having physical issues" and "Having part-time job". Self-blame was more frequent among students with "Worries about future competence/endurance", "Financial concerns", and "Academic workload". Male student tended to adopt humor strategy (beta = 0.19, p = 0.02), while less likely to utilize religious practices (beta = -0.21, p = 0.01).Conclusions Two-thirds of the participants reported moderate to high levels of stress. "Worries about future competence/endurance" was the most concerned stressor, followed by "Academic workload", and "Financial concerns". The first-year medical students reported high frequency of utilization "Self-distraction", "Problem-solving" and "Social support" when confronting stress. The findings may help inform the school management to better support students' well-being.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia and is characterized by low levels of acetyl and butyrylcholine, increased oxidative stress, inflammation, accumulation of metals, and aggregations of A beta and tau proteins. Current treatments for AD provide only symptomatic relief without impacting the pathological hallmarks of the disease. In our ongoing efforts to develop naturally inspired novel multitarget molecules for AD, through extensive medicinal chemistry efforts, we have developed 13a, harboring the key functional groups to provide not only symptomatic relief but also targeting oxidative stress, able to chelate iron, inhibiting NLRP3, and A beta(1-42) aggregation in various AD models. 13a exhibited promising anticholinesterase activity against AChE (IC50 = 0.59 +/- 0.19 mu M) and BChE (IC50 = 5.02 +/- 0.14 mu M) with excellent antioxidant properties in DPPH assay (IC50 = 5.88 +/- 0.21 mu M) over ferulic acid (56.49 +/- 0.62 mu M). The molecular docking and dynamic simulations further corroborated the enzyme inhibition studies and confirmed the stability of these complexes. Importantly, in the PAMPA-BBB assay, 13a turned out to be a promising molecule that can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Notably, 13a also exhibited iron-chelating properties. Furthermore, 13a effectively inhibited self- and metal-induced A beta(1-42) aggregation. It is worth mentioning that 13a demonstrated no symptom of cytotoxicity up to 30 mu M concentration in PC-12 cells. Additionally, 13a inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome and mitigated mitochondrial-induced reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential damage triggered by LPS and ATP in HMC-3 cells. 13a could effectively reduce mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Drosophila model of AD. Finally, 13a was found to be efficacious in reversing memory impairment in a scopolamine-induced AD mouse model in the in vivo studies. In ex vivo assessments, 13a notably modulates the levels of superoxide, catalase, and malondialdehyde along with AChE and BChE. These findings revealed that 13a holds promise as a potential candidate for further development in AD management.

AB  - Pantothenate synthetase protein plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), which is a crucial molecule involved in a number of cellular processes including the metabolism of fatty acid, energy production, and the synthesis of various biomolecules, which is necessary for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Therefore, inhibiting this protein could disrupt CoA synthesis, leading to the impairment of vital metabolic processes within the bacterium, ultimately inhibiting its growth and survival. This study employed molecular docking, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to identify promising phytochemical compounds targeting pantothenate synthetase for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Among 239 compounds, the top three (rutin, sesamin, and catechin gallate) were selected, with binding energy values ranging from -11 to -10.3 kcal/mol, and the selected complexes showed RMSD (<3 & Aring;) for 100 ns MD simulation time. Furthermore, molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations affirmed the stability of these three selected phytochemicals with binding energy ranges from -82.24 +/- 9.35 to -66.83 +/- 4.5 kcal/mol. Hence, these identified natural plant-derived compounds as potential inhibitors of pantothenate synthetase could be used to inhibit TB infection in humans.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a grave public health concern and is considered the foremost contributor to human mortality resulting from infectious disease. Due to the stringent clonality and extremely restricted genomic diversity, conventional methods prove inefficient for in-depth exploration of minor genomic variations and the evolutionary dynamics operating in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) populations. Until now, the majority of reviews have primarily focused on delineating the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in predicting antibiotic resistant genes, surveillance of drug resistance strains, and M.tb lineage classifications. Despite the growing use of next generation sequencing (NGS) and WGS analysis in TB research, there are limited studies that provide a comprehensive summary of there role in studying macroevolution, minor genetic variations, assessing mixed TB infections, and tracking transmission networks at an individual level. This highlights the need for systematic effort to fully explore the potential of WGS and its associated tools in advancing our understanding of TB epidemiology and disease transmission. We delve into the recent bioinformatics pipelines and NGS strategies that leverage various genetic features and simultaneous exploration of host-pathogen protein expression profile to decipher the genetic heterogeneity and host-pathogen interaction dynamics of the M.tb infections. This review highlights the potential benefits and limitations of NGS and bioinformatics tools and discusses their role in TB detection and epidemiology. Overall, this review could be a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians interested in NGS-based approaches in TB research.

AB  - AimsUrothelial carcinoma (UC) demonstrates significant molecular and histologic heterogeneity. The WHO 2022 classification has hinted at adding molecular signatures to the morphologic diagnosis. As morphology and associated molecular repertoire may potentially translate to choices of and response to therapy and relapse rate, broader acceptability of recognizing these key features among uropathologists is needed. This prompted an international survey to ascertain the practice patterns in classical/subtype UC among uropathologists across the globe.Methods and ResultsA survey instrument was shared among 98 uropathologists using SurveyMonkey software. Anonymized respondent data were analysed. The response rate was 85%. A majority were in concordance with the profiles of luminal (93%) and basal (82%) types. Opinion on the FGFR3 testing platform was variable. While 95% concurred that TERT promoter mutation is the key driver in UC, 72% had the opinion that APOBEC mutagenesis is the main signature in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Uropathologists have divergent opinions on MIBC and ERCC2 mutations. Among the participants, 94% would quantify aggressive micropapillary and sarcomatoid histology, while 88% would reevaluate another transurethral resection of the bladder tumour specimen in nonmuscle invasive tumour with micropapillary, small cell, or sarcomatoid histology. A leading number agreed to specific molecular signatures of micropapillary (93%), plasmacytoid (97%), and small cell (86%) subtypes. Ninety-six percent of participants agreed that a small-cell component portends a more aggressive course and should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 63% would perform HER2/neu testing only on oncologist's request in advanced tumours. Ninety percent agreed that microsatellite instability testing, although not a standard protocol, should be considered in young patients with upper tract UC. Eighty-six percent agreed that UC with high tumour mutational burden would be a better candidate for immunotherapy.ConclusionIn the era of precision medicine, enhanced understanding of molecular heterogeneity of UC will contribute to better therapeutic options, novel biomarker discovery, innovative management protocols, and outcomes. Our survey provides a broad perspective of pathologists' perceptions and experience regarding incorporation of histomolecular approaches to "personalize" therapy. Due to variable clinical adoption, there is a need for additional data using uniform study criteria. This will drive generation of best practice guidelines in this area for widespread and consistent clinical utility.

AB  - Background Supratentorial intraventricular tumors, encompassing lateral and third ventricular tumors, are uncommon intracranial neoplasms, typically slow-growing and benign, manifesting symptoms only upon reaching a substantial size. This study aims to identify optimal surgical approaches, assess the prevalence and characteristics of these tumors, and evaluate postoperative outcomes among pediatric and adult age groups.
   Methods A retrospective comparative study at a tertiary care hospital from January 2014 to June 2020 included 165 patients (68 pediatrics, 97 adults) meeting inclusion criteria for intraventricular tumor management. Data covered demographic factors, clinical history, neurological assessments, neuroimaging, surgical approaches, histopathological diagnoses, immunohistochemical features, adjuvant therapies, follow-up status, postoperative complications, and morbidity/mortality.
   Results Ventricular tumor incidence showed male preponderance in both adults (M:F = 1.2:1) and pediatrics (M:F = 3:1). Lateral ventricles were the most common location. Pediatric cases exhibited more frequent calcifications on computed tomography scans (35.6% vs. 29.5%). Grade II and III tumors were more prevalent in adults within the lateral ventricle (27.1 and 1.9%) compared with pediatrics (6.5 and 8.4%). The third ventricle predominantly featured benign lesions, with pediatric patients experiencing significantly longer hospital stays (16.12 +/- 21.94 days vs. 9.58 +/- 6.21 days) (p = 0.006). Adults and pediatric patients showed a significant difference in high-grade lateral ventricle tumors ( p -value = 0.002).
   Conclusions Supratentorial ventricular tumors are relatively more prevalent in children than adults, presenting challenges due to size and bleeding risks. Surgical resection is the primary treatment, with a focus on the optimal approach for gross total excision to reduce recurrence risk.

AB  - Olfml3 is a microglia-specific protein whose role in neuroinflammation is elusive. In silico analysis was conducted to characterize the Olfml3 protein, followed by molecular docking and MD simulation to check possible interaction with Iba1. Further, expression and co-localization analysis was performed in the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice brains. Results suggest that Olfml3 physically interacts with Iba1. Olfml3 and Iba1 expression increases during neuroinflammation in mice brains. Olfml3 was observed to co-localize with Iba1, and the number of Olfml3 and Iba1 dual-positive cells increased in the brain of the neuroinflammatory mice model. Thus, Olfml3 could potentially participate in microglia functions by interacting with Iba1.

AB  - Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies target the desmosomal proteins resulting in blistering of oral mucosa and skin. While the pathogenesis of PV is mainly mediated by the adaptive immune system, key players of innate immunity are also emerging. This study outlines the phenotypic as well as functional attributes of NK cells in PV. Through in-depth analysis using flow cytometry we identified an increase in the frequency of CD56+ + CD3-- NK cells and their subtypes in periphery. Along with this there is an increased frequency of IFN gamma+ gamma + CD56 bright CD16dim dim NK cells. mRNA expression of sorted NK cells for differentially expressed genes, particularly key transcription factors such as T-bet and EOMES, as well as surface receptors like NKG2D and KIR2D, and the cytokine IFN gamma, gamma, displayed significant upregulation. A significant activation of NK cells was seen in the disease state. The levels of perforin and IFN gamma gamma were significantly elevated in the culture supernatants of patients. Additionally, a significantly higher cytotoxicity of NK cells in PV was observed. In lesioned tissues of PV, NK related markers were significantly increased. Lastly, we observed NK cells using confocal microscopy in the tissue biopsies of patients which showed significant infiltration of CD56+ + CD3-- NK cells at the lesional sites. This study aimed to shed light on the pivotal role of NK cells in the immunopathology of PV, offering a thorough understanding of their behaviour and changes in expression which might help in contributing to the development of novel therapeutics.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the End of life care (EOLC ) practices and the magnitude of futile care in a tertiary cancer center. To find out the barriers in provision of good EOLC in cancer patients. Methods: An observational study was done on 129 patients. Patients were enrolled using the palliative prognostic index (PPI) in the end of life stages. Socio-demographic and clinical details were recorded. Detailed counselling done by the palliative physician or the oncologist was recorded. The barriers in provision of care were recorded. Results: In this study initial experience of 129 patients were analyzed. PPI score was >6 (survival shorter than 3 weeks) in 85 (65.89%) ; 34 (26.36%) had PPI score between >4 to 6 (survival between 3 to 6 weeks); and 10 (7.75%) patients had PPI score less than equal to 4( survival more than 6 weeks).77 (59.69%) patients preferred home as their place for EOLC while 41(31.78%) preferred hospital, 7 (5.43%) preferred hospice while 4 (3.10%) opted ICU for their EOLC . The most common barrier associated was caregiver related in 34 case, followed by physician related in 14 cases and patients related in 3 cases, because of hope of being cured in hospital, social stigma, fear of worsening of symptoms at home, denial. Conclusion: EOLC is the least studied part of patient care with various barriers. With proper communication and a good palliative care support, futile treatment can be avoided. With healthy communication we can empower family members and patients for a good EOLC.

AB  - BackgroundSpinal arteriovenous shunts and spinal dysraphism both have a different underlying cause, disease spectrum and developmental process; hence, these entities rarely coexist in a patient. Here, we reported four cases of coexistence of adult-onset spinal arteriovenous shunt and spinal dysraphism in the same patient along with their therapeutic embolisation. Additionally, we conducted an extensive literature review to explore the potential theories and explanations for this coexistence.MethodsWe retrospectively searched our imaging database from January 2015 to December 2023 to identify instances of spinal arteriovenous shunts occurring in patients with spinal dysraphism or neural tube defect disorders. MRI and angiographic imaging, clinical presentation, treatment and follow-up were analysed.ResultsFour patients with arteriovenous fistula/shunt and spinal dysraphism were included in the study. The mean age of presentation was 35.5 years. The most common symptoms were sensory disturbance and motor weakness. Arteriovenous fistula or shunt was located at the lumber region in one patient and at the sacral region in three cases. Two patients have a prior history of surgery in first decade. Two patients were treated with glue embolisation. The internal iliac artery was a common feeder in all cases.ConclusionsThe rare coexistence of neural tube defects with spinal vascular abnormalities should be considered when assessing a middle-aged patient with neural tube defect and myelopathy. Correct diagnosis can help in treatment planning and thereby improve prognosis.

AB  - Introduction The treatment approach for recently diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations primarily relies on confirming the tissue diagnosis as non-squamous NSCLC. This routine clinical practice of tissue diagnosis imposes several barriers and delays in turnaround time (TAT) for biomarker testing, significantly delaying the time to treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the 'plasma first' approach for detection of EGFR mutation in advanced stage treatment na & iuml;ve NSCLC patients. Methods We prospectively collected blood samples of treatment na & iuml;ve patients with clinical and radiological suspicion of advanced stage NSCLC prior to obtaining tissue biopsy. Plasma cfDNA was tested for EGFR mutation using two different methods. We compared the sensitivity and TAT of liquid biopsy with tissue biopsy. Results In total, we analyzed plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of 236 patients suspected of having advanced NSCLC for EGFR mutations. We observed a notably shorter turnaround time (TAT) of 3 days, which was significantly quicker compared to the 12-day TAT for tissue biopsy (p < 0.05). The ddPCR method had a sensitivity of 82.8%, which was higher than 66.34% sensitivity of ARMS-PCR. The current study also highlights that there is no significant difference in the clinical outcome of the patients whether treated based on liquid biopsy only or tissue biopsy (median progression-free survival of 11.56 vs. 11.9 months; p = 0.94). Conclusions Utilizing a 'plasma first' strategy, given its shorter turnaround time, strong positive concordance and comparable outcomes to tissue biopsy, emerges as a highly specific and reliable method for detecting EGFR mutations in advanced-stage NSCLC.

AB  - PurposeThis study evaluates the efficacy of SISCOS (Subtraction ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to SPECT) in localizing the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), comparing its predictive performance with MRI and post-surgical outcomes based on ILAE classification.Methods84 patients with drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) who were operated and had histopathology consistent with FCD, were included in the study. All patients had undergone a complete work-up including SISCOS and MRI for EZ localization, followed by discussion in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery meeting prior to surgery. Ictal & interictal perfusion SPECT studies were performed with Tc-99 m Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (Tc-99 m ECD) followed by SISCOS analysis using SPM2 and Bioimage Suite 2.6. Concordance for localization was determined by comparing with the surgical resection site and post-surgical outcomes were assessed using the ILAE classification.ResultsThe concordance for EZ localization demonstrated by SISCOS was 73.8% and MRI was 82.1%. 52 patients (61.9%) had good surgical outcome and 31(59%) of these were FCD type 2. In patients with discordant MRI findings, SISCOS was able to provide localisation in 86% (13/15), with 69.2% showing good surgical outcomes. Sensitivity of SISCOS and MRI was 73% (95% CI = 59-84.8%) and 78% (95% CI = 67.5-90.3%) respectively with no significant difference between the two. In FCD type I, both SISCOS and MRI revealed a similar a sensitivity of 76.4% (95%CI = 50.1-93.2%). Concordant cases exhibited higher seizure-free odds ratios for both modalities.ConclusionSISCOS is effective in localizing the EZ in FCD patients, comparable to MRI. Integrating SISCOS and MRI enhances lesion detection, especially in MRI discordant cases. A comprehensive diagnostic approach utilizing SISCOS and MRI can optimize the non-invasive pre-surgical assessment in DRE thereby guiding surgical decision-making in a resource-limited setting.

AB  - BackgroundHousehold air pollution arising from combustion of unclean fuels during cooking activities causes serious respiratory health effects. This study investigated patterns of household cooking fuel use and its effect on respiratory health status of women and children.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in rural households of Ballabgarh, Haryana during December 2019 to January 2020 among 18-45 years old women and their children having age between 6 and 59 months. A total of 450 households were selected using simple random sampling. Cooking fuel use was categorised as unclean (Wood, dung cakes, crop residues) and clean (LPG and electricity). The classification of mixed fuel use (predominantly unclean or clean) was based upon duration of unclean fuel use >= 2.5 h per day. The clinical history and physical examination was done using a semi-structured questionnaire. Assessment of respiratory health status of women participants was done using peak expiratory flow meter and presence of pneumonia in children was evaluated as per Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) guidelines.ResultsOverall use of unclean cooking fuels was predominant in 59.6% of households and 71.8% of households had mixed fuel use. Only clean fuel use was in 11.3% of households. Nasal stuffiness, breathing difficulty and cough were observed among 13.1%, 10.5% and 8.5% among women while the common respiratory symptoms in children were cough (27.8%) and runny nose (22.9%). As compared to clean fuels, women using unclean fuels were more likely to have any respiratory symptom (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.5-6.0) and impaired pulmonary functions (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9). Cooking fuel use was not associated with respiratory symptoms and presence of pneumonia in children living in the households.ConclusionCooking with unclean fuel continues to be prevalent in the households of rural Ballabgarh and adversely affects the respiratory health of women indicating strengthening of initiatives promoting clean fuel use.

AB  - The presence of a normal large blood vessel (LBV) in a tumor region can impact the evaluation of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters and tumor classification. Hence, there is a need for automatic removal of LBVs from brain tissues including intratumoral regions for achieving an objective assessment of tumors. This retrospective study included 103 histopathologically confirmed brain tumor patients who underwent MRI, including DCE-MRI data acquisition. Quantitative DCE-MRI analysis was performed for computing various parameters such as wash-out slope (Slope-2), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), blood plasma volume fraction (Vp), and volume transfer constant (K-trans). An approach based on data-clustering algorithm, morphological operations, and quantitative DCE-MRI maps was proposed for the segmentation of normal LBVs in brain tissues, including the tumor region. Here, three widely used data-clustering algorithms were evaluated on two types of quantitative maps: (a) Slope-2, and (b) a new proposed combination of rCBV and Slope-2 maps. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-MRI hyperintense lesions were also automatically segmented using deep learning-based architecture. The accuracy of LBV segmentation was qualitatively assessed blindly by two experienced observers, and Likert scoring was also obtained from each individual and compared using Cohen's Kappa test, and multiple statistical features from quantitative DCE-MRI parameters were obtained in the segmented tumor. t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for comparing the effect of removal of LBVs on parameters as well as on tumor grading. k-means clustering exhibited better accuracy and computational efficiency. Tumors, in particular high-grade gliomas (HGGs), showed a high contrast compared with normal tissues (relative % difference = 18.5%) on quantitative maps after the removal of LBVs. Statistical features (95(th) percentile values) of all parameters in the tumor region showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between with and without LBV maps. Similar results were obtained for the ROC curve analysis for differentiation between low-grade gliomas and HGGs. Moreover, after the removal of LBVs, the rCBV, rCBF, and Vp maps show better visualization of tumor regions.

AB  - Objectives: Perimarginal nodes (PMN) lie in close relationship with marginal mandibular nerve (MMN), in the lymphatic drainage pathway of gingivo-buccal cancers (GBC), above the lower border of mandible and remain unaddressed in conventional neck dissection. We have aimed to define the boundaries of perimarginal node dissection, explore incidence of PMN metastasis and its correlation with histopathological characteristics. Materials and methods: A prospective study was conducted on 112 consecutive patients of GB carcinoma. PMN dissection was performed in an anatomically defined quadrangle. Prospective clinical characteristics included subsite, tumor and nodal stage, location of primary and clinical skin involvement. Histopathological characteristics analyzed included grade, size, pathological tumor, nodal stage, skin and/or bone involvement, depth of invasion, Brandwein Gensler histological risk score and lympho-vascular emboli. MMN function was graded at 3 and 6 months post-operatively. Results: The PMN were identified histologically in 75.89 % patients. 15.2 % patients harboured metastasis in PMN. 16.7% patients had clinically occult metastasis with 11.7% having isolated PMN metastasis. None of the pre-operative clinical factors was found to be significant in predicting incidence of metastasis. Higher nodal burden (p = 0.01) and pathological skin involvement (p = 0.03) were found statistically significant on multivariable analysis. At 6 months follow-up, none of the patients had any MMN functional deformity at rest. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of occult PMN metastasis from gingivo-buccal complex cancer. High nodal stage and pathological skin involvement are independent predictors for PMN metastasis. PMN dissection must be performed in all cases of GB cancer.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Data provided from blood donors have contributed to the understanding of public health epidemiology and policy decisions. A recent example was during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic when blood services monitored the seroprevalence in blood donors. Based on this experience, blood services have the opportunity to expand their role and participate in public health surveillance and research. The aim of this report is to share available resources to assist blood services in this area. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance, Risk Assessment and Policy (SRAP) Sub-group of the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) Transfusion Transmitted Infectious Diseases (TTID) Working Party developed a Public Health Research Toolkit to assist blood services and researchers interested in expanding their role in public health research.

AB  - BackgroundSurgery is the primary treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but microscopic residual disease may be unavoidable. Preclinical studies have shown that volatile anesthetics might suppress host immunity and promote a pro-malignant environment that supports cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, whereas propofol may preserve cell-mediated immunity and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. However, clinical evidence that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) can reduce tumor recurrence after curative resection remains inconsistent due to the retrospective observational nature of previous studies. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that the recurrence-free survival (RFS) after curative resection of NSCLC is higher in patients who received TIVA than volatile anesthetics (GAS) in this multicenter randomized trial.MethodsThis double-blind, randomized trial will enroll patients at 22 international sites, subject to study registration, institutional review board approval, and patient written informed consent. Eligible patients are adult patients undergoing lung resection surgery with curative intent for NSCLC. Exclusion criteria will be contraindications to study drugs, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status IV or higher, or preexisting distant metastasis or malignant tumor in other organs. At each study site, enrolled subjects will be randomly allocated into the TIVA and GAS groups with a 1:1 ratio. This pragmatic trial does not standardize any aspect of patient care. However, potential confounders will be balanced between the study arms. The primary outcome will be RFS. Secondary outcomes will be overall survival and complications within postoperative 7 days. Enrollment of 5384 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 3% treatment effect (hazard ratio of 0.83) at alpha 0.05 for RFS at 3 years.DiscussionConfirmation of the study hypothesis would demonstrate that a relatively minor and low-cost alteration in anesthetic management has the potential to reduce cancer recurrence risk in NSCLC, an ultimately fatal complication. Rejection of the hypothesis would end the ongoing debate about the relationship between cancer recurrence and anesthetic management.Trial registrationThe study protocol was prospectively registered at the Clinical trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT06330038, principal investigator: Hyun Joo Ahn; date of first public release: March 25, 2024) before the recruitment of the first participant.
