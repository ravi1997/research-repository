        "title": "Lifestyle modification in school-going children before and after COVID-19 lockdown",
        "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on lifestyle of school-going children. Methods: This was a questionnaire-based prospective study of 1237 school children aged 9-14 years enrolled from various private and government schools across Delhi in October-December 2020. These children were being followed-up over the previous 2 years (before pandemic) with details of their lifestyle like near/outdoor/reading activities using a questionnaire as a part of another study. The data during the COVID-19 lockdown was collected by telephonic interview. This was compared to similar information collected from this cohort in the pre-Covid period in 2019 when the students had a regular physical school curriculum. Results: A significant decline was noted in time spent on outdoor activity (from 8.5 hours/week in pre-COVID-19 time to 1.6 hours/week during COVID-19 lockdown; P < 0.001) and doing homework offline (from 15.3 hour/week to 14 hours/week; P < 0.001). A significant increase was noted in screen time spent on digital devices (from 6.2 hours/week to 19.8 hours/week; P<0.001), and watching television (from 12.2 hours/week to 13.4 hours/week; P < 0.001). The rise in the digital on-screen time was significantly more in boys (P < 0.001) and in students from private schools (P < 0.001). The rise in the duration of watching television was significantly more in girls than boys (P < 0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown has markedly impacted the lifestyle of school children by significantly decreasing the outdoor activity and increasing the screen time, thereby pre-disposing them to ocular ill-health and myopia. This necessitates the adoption of guidelines for promoting healthy digital habits in children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence of myopia and its risk factors in rural school children. METHODS: Children in classes 4-7 of eight randomly selected schools (five government and three private) in rural Haryana, with unaided vision <6/9.5 were screened, their cycloplegic refraction is done, myopes were identified. A questionnaire-based assessment of risk factors was done for myopes and compared with 10% of randomly selected children with normal vision (controls). The prevalence of myopia and its association with risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: Children screened were 1486 (89.5% coverage). The mean age of children was 11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 years with 861 (57.9%) boys. Prevalence of myopia was 6.4% (95% Confidence intervals [CI]: 5.2%, 7.8%). Prevalence was higher among private schools (10.1%) compared to government schools (1.4%) (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and among girls 7.2% (45/625) compared to boys 5.8% (50/861) (p\u2009=\u20090.2786). The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -1.61D\u2009\u00b1\u20091.32D. The prevalence of high myopia was 1.1% (1/95). There was a 75% unmet need for spectacles. Studying in private school was positively associated with myopia as per our multivariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.016). An inverse association was found for time spent outdoors (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Watching television, indoor time, screen time, age, or gender were not found to be statistically significant as risk factors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of myopia is increasing among children of rural areas, especially those in private schools with a strong inverse association with time spent outdoors. Regular screening, lifestyle modification and awareness about modifiable risk factors are essential.",

        "abstract": "The primacy of primary health care The Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978 was a landmark in the history of public health, as it emphasised primary health care as a prerequisite for the pursuit of health and wellbeing of all individuals.(1) Six years later, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocated the implementation of primary eye care through the primary health care system.(2) Primary eye care is defined as \u201ca \u2018frontline\u2019 activity, providing eye care and identifying disease before it becomes a serious medical issue\u201d.(3) The provision of primary eye care is a challenge in many countries of South East Asia (SEA) Region, as the health care system lacks adequate human resources. At the primary level, the government is the principal service provider in India. In Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, eye care is predominantly managed by the government, whereas in Nepal and Bangladesh the NGO sector is the predominant service provider.(4) The challenge of providing primary eye care can be met by setting up vision centres (one per 50,000 population), as has been  done in India. They are facilities that provide community eye care and are integrated into the primary health care system. Managed by skilled ophthalmic assistants, the vision centres are the first point of contact for eye health needs for the community.",

Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 10,000 school children aged 5 to 15 years screened after an interval of 1 year to identify new myopes (Spherical Equivalent\u2264 -0.5D) and progression of myopia in previously diagnosed myopic children. Association between risk factors and progression was analyzed using adjusted odds ratio. Results Of the 9,616 children re-screened (97.3% coverage), annual incidence of myopia was 3.4%with mean dioptric change of -1.09 \u00b1 0.55. There was a significant higher incidence of myopia in younger children compared to older children (P = 0.012) and among girls compared to boys (P = 0.002). Progression was observed in 49.2%children with mean dioptric change of -0.27 \u00b1 0.42 diopters. The demographic and behavioral risk factors were analyzed for children with progression (n = 629) and adjusted odds ratio values were estimated. Hours of reading-writing/week (p<0.001), use of computers/ video games (P<0.001) and watching television (P = 0.048) were significant risk factors for progression of myopia. Outdoor activities / time spent outdoors> 2 hours in a day were protective with an inverse association with progression of myopia (P< 0.001). Conclusion Myopia is an important health issue in India and is associated with long hours of reading and screen time with use of computers and video games. An annual eye vision screening should be conducted, and outdoor activities be promoted to prevent the increase of myopia among school children.",

Objectives To compare patient characteristics, health seeking, delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation among new sputum smear positive TB patients detected through ACF and passive case finding (PCF) under the national TB programme in marginalized and vulnerable populations between March 2016 and February 2017. Methods This observational analytic study was conducted in 18 randomly sampled Axshya districts. We enrolled all TB patients detected through ACF and an equal number of randomly selected patients detected through PCF in the same settings. Data on patient characteristics, health seeking and delays were collected through record review and patient interviews (at their residence). Delays included patient level delay (from eligibility for sputum examination to first contact with any health care provider (HCP)), health system level diagnosis delay (from contact with first HCP to TB diagnosis) and treatment initiation delays (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Total delay was the sum of patient level, health system level diagnosis delay and treatment initiation delays. Results We included 234 ACF-diagnosed and 231 PCF-diagnosed patients. When compared to PCF, ACF patients were relatively older (\u226565 years, 14% versus 8%, p = 0.041), had no formal education (57% versus 36%, p<0.001), had lower monthly income per capita (median 13.1 versus 15.7 USD, p = 0.014), were more likely from rural areas (92% versus 81%, p<0.002) and residing far away from the sputum microscopy centres (more than 15 km, 24% versus 18%, p = 0.126). Fewer patients had history of significant loss of weight (68% versus 78%, p = 0.011) and sputum grade of 3+ (15% versus 21%, p = 0.060). Compared to PCF, HCP visits among ACF patients was significantly lower (median one versus two HCPs, p<0.001). ACF patients had significantly lower health system level diagnosis delay (median five versus 19 days, p = 0.008) and the association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Patient level and total delays were not significantly different. Conclusion Axshya SAMVAD linked the most impoverished communities to TB care and resulted in reduction of health system level diagnosis delay.",

        "abstract": "Community-level benefits of screening for active tuberculosis (TB) disease remain uncertain. Project Axshya (meaning free of TB) conducted advocacy, communication, social mobilization, and active case finding among vulnerable/marginalized populations of India. Among 15 districts of Jharkhand state, the project was initiated in 36 subdistrict level administrative units - tuberculosis units (TUs) in a staggered manner between April 2013 and September 2014, and continued till the end of 2015. Seven TUs did not implement the project. We assessed the relative change in the quarterly TB case finding indicators (n = 4) after inclusion of a TU within the project. By fitting four multilevel models (mixed-effects maximum likelihood regression using random intercept), we adjusted for secular (over previous five quarters) and seasonal trends, baseline differences within Axshya and non-Axshya TUs, and population size and clustering within districts and within TUs. After inclusion of a TU within the project, we found a significant increase [95% confidence interval (CI)] in TU-level presumptive TB sputum examination rate, new sputum-positive TB Case Notification Rate (CNR), sputum-positive TB CNR, and all forms TB CNR by 12 (5.5, 18.5), 1.1 (0.5, 1.7), 1.3 (0.6, 2.0), and 1.2 (0.1, 2.2) per 100,000 population per quarter, respectively. Overall, the project resulted in an increase (95% CI) in sputum examination and detection of new sputum-positive TB, sputum-positive TB and all forms of TB patients by 22,410 (10,203, 34,077), 2066 (923, 3210), 2380 (1162, 3616), and 2122 (203, 4059), respectively. This provides evidence for implementing project Axshya over and above the existing passive case finding.",

        "abstract": "Background: Community-based active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) implemented among marginalised and vulnerable populations in 285 districts of India resulted in reduction of diagnosis delay and prevalence of catastrophic costs due to TB diagnosis. We were interested to know whether this translated into improved treatment outcomes. Globally, there is limited published literature from marginalised and vulnerable populations on the independent effect of community-based ACF on treatment outcomes when compared to passive case finding (PCF).Objectives: To determine the relative differences in unfavourable treatment outcomes (death, loss-to-follow-up, failure, not evaluated) of ACF and PCF-diagnosed people.Methods: Cohort study involving record reviews and interviews in 18 randomly selected districts. We enrolled all ACF-diagnosed people with new smear-positive pulmonary TB, registered under the national TB programme between March 2016 and February 2017, and an equal number of randomly selected PCF-diagnosed people in the same settings. We used log binomial models to adjust for confounders.Results: Of 572 enrolled, 275 belonged to the ACF and 297 to the PCF group. The proportion of unfavourable outcomes were 10.2% (95% CI: 7.1%, 14.3%) in the ACF and 12.5% (95% CI: 9.2%, 16.7%) in the PCF group (p = 0.468). The association between ACF and unfavourable outcomes remained non-significant after adjusting for confounders available from records [aRR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.21)]. Due to patient non-availability at their residence, interviews were conducted for 465 (81.3%). In the 465 cohort too, there was no association after adjusting for confounders from records and interviews [aRR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.77)].Conclusion: We did not find significant differences in the treatment outcomes. Due to the wide CIs, studies with larger sample sizes are urgently required. Studies are required to understand how to translate the benefits of ACF to improved treatment outcomes.",

The morbidity due to disease is also quite high with an estimated 3.5% of population aged 40\u201380 years suffering from glaucoma (1,2). Broadly two types of primary glaucomas are identified, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angles closure glaucoma (PACG). Angle closure glaucomas constitute a spectrum that include primary angle closure suspects (PACS, occludable angles), persons with primary angle closure (PAC, occludable angles with features indicative of trabecular outflow obstruction but absence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy) and finally PACG (presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy). PACG is responsible for 31% of all cases globally, but the proportion has been reported to be higher in Asia at 40% (2). Data from population based studies in Asia show that PACG causes greater proportion of blindness than  POAG (3).",

High pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition and the reasons for these were identified. The recommendations from this OR were implemented and we planned to assess systematically whether there were any improvements., Objectives: Among patients with presumptive MDR-TB (July\u2013December 2014), 1) to determine pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition, 2) to determine factors associated with pre-diagnosis attrition, 3) to determine the turnaround time (TAT) from eligibility to testing and from diagnosis to treatment initiation, and 4) to compare these findings with those of the previous study (2012\u20132013)., Design: This was a retrospective cohort study based on record review., Results: Compared to the previous study, there was a decrease in pre-diagnosis attrition from 45% to 24% (P < 0.001), in pre-treatment attrition from 29% to 0% (P = 0.18), in the TAT from eligibility to testing from a median of 11 days to 10 days (P = 0.89) and in the TAT from diagnosis to treatment initiation from a median of 38 days to 19 days (P = 0.04). There is further scope for reducing pre-diagnosis attrition by addressing the high risk of patients with human immunodeficiency virus and TB co-infection or those with extra-pulmonary TB not undergoing drug susceptibility testing., Conclusion: The implementation of findings from OR resulted in improved programme outcomes.",

We performed a manual thematic analysis to identify the major reasons for using/not using EpiData., Results: Of 46 participants, 38 (83%) responded. Of 31 participants involved in research, 17 (55%) had used EpiData, of whom 6 (35%) had performed double entry and validation. Of the 14 who did not use EpiData, 11 had used MS Excel or SPSS/Epi Info for data entry. Of the 38 respondents, 29 (76%) had taught EpiData to other colleagues and students. Reasons for using EpiData included its user-friendliness, its being open access and the ease in preventing data entry errors. Reasons for not performing double entry included lack of time and manpower., Conclusion: The short course on EpiData was effective in knowledge transfer and provides a scalable model for incorporation into the teaching curricula of medical schools and research institutions.",

        "abstract": "Background Despite acute respiratory infections being a major cause of death among children in developing countries including India, there is a lack of community-based studies that document its burden and aetiology. Methods A dynamic cohort of children aged 0\u201310 years was established in four villages in a north Indian state of Haryana from August 2012 onwards. Trained health workers conducted weekly home visits to screen children for acute respiratory infection (ARI) defined as one of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, earache/discharge, or breathing difficulty. Nurses clinically assessed these children to grade disease severity based on standard age-specific guidelines into acute upper or lower respiratory infection (AURI or ALRI) and collected nasal/throat swabs for pathogen testing. Results Our first year results show that ARI incidence in 0\u201310 years of age was 5.9 (5.8\u20136.0) per child-year with minimal gender difference, the ALRI incidence in the under-five age group was higher among boys (0.43; 0.39\u20130.49) as compared to girls (0.31; 0.26\u20130.35) per child year. Boys had 2.4 times higher ARI-related hospitalization rate as compared to girls. Conclusion ARI impose a significant burden on the children of this cohort. This study platform aims to provide better evidence for prevention and control of pneumonia in developing countries.",

        "abstract": "SummaryBackground The annual number of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in young children worldwide is unknown. We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in 2010. Methods We estimated the incidence of admissions for severe and very severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age and region, with data from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global and regional burden in children admitted with severe ALRI in that year. We estimated in-hospital mortality due to severe and very severe ALRI by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based studies. Findings We identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11\u00b79 million (95% CI 10\u00b73\u201313\u00b79 million) episodes of severe and 3\u00b70 million (2\u00b71\u20134\u00b72 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide. Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies. On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265\u2008000 (95% CI 160\u2008000\u2013450\u2008000) in-hospital deaths took place in young children, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries. Therefore, the data suggest that although 62% of children with severe ALRI are treated in hospitals, 81% of deaths happen outside hospitals. Interpretation Severe ALRI is a substantial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause of hospital referral and admission in young children. Improved hospital access and reduced inequities, such as those related to sex and rural status, could substantially decrease mortality related to such infection. Community-based management of severe disease could be an important complementary strategy to reduce pneumonia mortality and health inequities. Funding WHO.",

The magnitude and the pattern of tobacco consumption are likely to be influenced by the geographical setting and with rapid urbanization in India there is a need to study this differential pattern. AIM The aim was to study the rural, urban, and urban-slum differences in patterns of tobacco use. SETTINGS The study was conducted in Ballabgarh block, Faridabad district, Haryana, and was a community-based cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted in years 2003-2004 using the WHO STEPS approach with 7891 participants, approximately equal number of males and females, selected using multistage sampling from urban, urban-slum, and rural strata. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The analysis was done using the SPSS 12.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Direct standardization to the WHO world standard population was done to and chi-square and ANOVA tests were used for comparison across three study settings. RESULTS Self-reported tobacco use among males was as follows: urban 35.2%; urban-slums 48.3%; and rural 52.6% (P value <0.05). Self-reported tobacco use among females was as follows: Urban 3.5%; urban-slums 11.9%; and rural 17.7% (P value <0.05). More males reported daily bidi (tobacco wrapped in temburini leaf) smoking (urban 17.8%, urban-slums 36.7%, rural 44.6%) than cigarette use (urban 9.6%, urban-slums 6.3%, rural 2.9%). Females using smoked tobacco were almost exclusively using bidis (urban 1.7%, 7.9%, 11% in rural). Daily chewed tobacco use had urban, urban-slum, and rural gradients of 12%, 10.5%, and 6.8% in males respectively. Its use was low in females. CONCLUSION The antitobacco policies of India need to focus on bidis in antitobacco campaigns. The program activities must find ways to reach the rural and urban-slum populations.",

        "title": "How to Effectively Monitor and Evaluate NCD Programmes in India",
        "abstract": "Program monitoring and evaluation (M and E) are important components of any program and are critical to sound strategic planning. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio-vascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) with the objectives to prevent and control common noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) through behaviour and lifestyle changes, and to provide early diagnosis and management of common NCDs. M and E of program requires identification of indicators that measure inputs, process, outputs, and outcomes. The frequency of collecting information for these indicators will vary depending on the level of use and type of indicator as well as time interval over which we expect to see a change in that parameter. A group of indicators for different domains in the three major strategies has been proposed. For effective monitoring and evaluation of NPCDCS, the way forward is to finalize the list of indicators; evolve sustainable systems for surveillance; collect baseline assessment of the indicators at district level; fix targets for each indicator for different time frames; periodic review at state and national level for monitoring progress; and establish external review mechanisms. Monitoring and evaluation require complex set of co-ordinated action, responsibility for which has to be taken up by the NCD Cell within the Ministries of Health at state and national level. However, the routine data collection and compilation could be the responsibility of Central Bureau of Health Intelligence. Integrated population-based surveys with existing disease and behaviour surveillance could be undertaken by National Centre for Disease Control. The national NCD cell should compile all these information into a meaningful policy brief so that appropriate programmatic interventions can be identified. The launch of a national program to tackle the burden of NCDs is just the beginning, and the final success of the program will depend on how effectively we monitor and evaluate it.",

This paper analyses longitudinal data from the Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site in north India to check its veracity. Methods A cohort of children born between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011 at Ballabgarh HDSS were followed till death, emigration, 3 years of age or end of the study. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by caste, parental combined years of schooling and wealth index and divided into low, mid and high strata for each of them. Sex ratio at birth (SRB) was reported as the number of girls per 1000 boys. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn and a Cox Proportional HR of girls over boys was estimated. Results A total of 12 517 native born children (25 797 child years) were enrolled of which 710 died (death rate of 56.7/1000-live births and 27.5/1000 child-years. Socioeconomically advantaged children had significantly lower death rates. The SRB (10\u201316% lower) and neonatal death rate were consistently adverse for girls in the advantaged groups by all the three indicators of SES. The first month survival rates were better for girls in the lower SES categories (significant only in caste (HR 0.58; 0.37 to 0.91). High SES categories consistently showed adverse survival rates for girls (HR of 1.22 to 1.59). Conclusions Better socioeconomic situation worsened the sex differentials, especially at birth. Therefore, specific interventions targeting gender issues are required, at least as a short-term measure.",

Design, setting and sample:\u2002 During July 2009-August 2011, we collected clinical data and specimens (nasal and throat swabs) from rural patients hospitalized for acute medical illnesses. Specimens were tested by rRT-PCR for influenza viruses. Main outcome measures:\u2002 Case definitions evaluated the following: influenza-like illness (ILI: measured fever plus cough or sore throat); severe acute respiratory illness (SARI: ILI with difficulty breathing in \u22655\u2003years, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness-defined pneumonia or severe pneumonia, or physician diagnosed lower respiratory infection in <5\u2003years); acute respiratory infection (ARI: \u22651 of cough, nasal discharge, difficulty breathing or sore throat); febrile acute respiratory illness (FARI: fever plus either cough, sore throat, runny nose, difficulty breathing, or earache). Variants that included \"reported fever\" and additional sign-symptom combinations were also evaluated. Results:\u2002 We enrolled 1043 hospitalized patients, including 257 children <5\u2003years of age (range 1\u2003day-86\u2003years). Seventy-four patients tested influenza virus positive (including 28 A(H1N1)pdm09). Sensitivity(95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) for influenza infection were 78% (67-87) and 60% (57-63) for ILI (measured/reported fever); 37% (26-49) and 78% (75-80) for SARI (measured/reported fever); 82% (72-90) and 57% (54-60) for FARI (measured/reported fever); 88% (78-94) and 45% (42-49) for ARI; and 74% (63-84) and 61% (58-64) for measured/reported fever plus cough. Case definitions including only measured fever had lower sensitivity. Conclusion:\u2002 ILI and FARI with measured/reported fever provided good balance between sensitivity and specificity among hospitalized patients. The simpler case definition of measured/reported fever plus cough is suited for field surveillance.",

        "title": "From reorientation of medical education to development of medical educators",
        "abstract": "Re-orientation of medical education in India has not been fully successful because the development of medical teacher, a critical component has not been adequately addressed. Faculty development is a key factor. We have identified six shifting trends in faculty development that can contribute to the development of a medical educator in India. These include a shift from: One time training to continuing professional development; information based approach to project based approach; training to scholarship; lack of accountability to accountability and recognition; individual efforts to networking; and role of treatment providers to health promoters. We have discussed how these shifts are in tune with the global trends. We recommend that the initiatives taken in India in the recent past, viz., constitution of a Task Force by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, establishment of several medical education centers should be harnessed by forming a national working group. Such a group would provide policy directions for faculty development which will lead to a concrete plan for implementation and thereby addressing a critical component of the re-orientation of medical education.",

        "title": "Hypertension Vaccine may be a boon to millions in developing world",
        "abstract": "Hypertension affects around 40% adults aged 25 years and more worldwide, and accounts for 7% of total disability-adjusted life-years. A simple algorithmic program is required to manage hypertension consisting of screening, life style measures, treatment and follow-up, a reliable drug supply and distribution system, and a credible health information system. Despite availability of effective antihypertensive drugs, long term treatment is still costly, tedious, and at the population level rather unsuccessful. Hypertension leaves patients and families with an avoidable heavy economic burden due to failure to control blood pressure. Health policy needs to address gross imbalance between prevention and management by increasing contribution to the preventive programs. During 21st century, the risk factors for morbidity and mortality have been changed, and researchers have started to work upon vaccines against lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes etc. Researchers began experimenting with vaccines against the renin-angiotensin system to control hypertension around six decades ago. The vaccine candidates against hypertension namely ATR12181, pHAV-4Ang IIs, CYT006-AngQb, AngI-R, ATRQ\u03b2-001 have shown promising results. A candidate vaccine, CYT006-AngQb, has crossed initial phase and moved into phase 2 trials. However, more human studies in subsequent phases of trials are required to establish the safety and efficacy of anti-hypertensive vaccine. If proved safe and cost effective, a vaccine even with 50% efficacy against hypertension may protect about 90 million people from hypertension and its heavy economic burden. It can be an appropriate solution for low compliance to antihypertensive drug therapy as well as an avalanche to induce efforts on various chronic disease vaccine development programs.",

Participants were children aged 2-59 months with WHO defined non-severe pneumonia, with or without wheeze, who were accessible to follow up. From seven primary health centers in each arm, 2009 cases were randomized, 993 and 1016 in treatment with amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Fever was present in 1247 (62.1%) and wheeze in 443 (22.1%). There was good adherence and low loss to follow-up. Clinical failure on amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole on intention to treat analysis was 137 and 97, respectively (absolute difference = 0.04, 95% confidence interval: - 0.035-0.12). We conclude that there was no difference in effectiveness of oral co-trimoxazole or amoxycillin in treating non-severe pneumonia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the on-going epidemiological transition, information on the pattern of mortality is important for health planning. Verbal autopsy (VA) is an established tool to ascertain the cause of death in areas where routine registration systems are incomplete or inaccurate. We estimated cause-specific mortality rates in rural adult population of 28 villages of Ballabgarh in North India using VA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During 2002-2007, trained multi-purpose health workers conducted 2294 VA interviews and underlying cause of death was coded by physicians. Proportional mortality (%) was calculated by dividing the number of deaths attributed to a specific cause by the total number of deaths for which a VA was carried out. FINDINGS: 61% of deaths occurred among males and 59% occurred among those aged \u226560 years. The leading causes of death were diseases of the respiratory system (18.7%) and the circulatory system (18.1%). Infectious causes and injuries and other external causes, each accounted for around 15% of total deaths followed by neoplasms (6.8%) and diseases of the digestive system (4%). Among those 45 years of age or more than half of deaths were attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) alone. Accidents and injuries were responsible for one-fourth of deaths in 15-30 years age group. CONCLUSION: NCDs and injuries are emerging as major causes of death in this region thereby posing newer challenges to public health system.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Though respiratory viruses are thought to cause substantial morbidity globally in children aged <5 years, the burden of severe respiratory virus infections in children is unknown in India where 20% of the world's children live. METHODS: During August 2009-July 2011, prospective population-based surveillance was conducted for hospitalizations of children aged <5 years in a rural community in Haryana State. Clinical data and respiratory specimens were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, and adenovirus. Average annual hospitalization incidence was calculated using census data and adjusted for hospitalizations reported on a community healthcare utilization survey to occur at non-study hospitals. RESULTS: Of 245 hospitalized children, respiratory viruses were detected among 98 (40%), of whom 92 (94%) had fever or respiratory symptoms. RSV (34.6/10,000, 95% CI 26.6-44.7) accounted for the highest virus-associated hospitalization incidences and 20% of hospitalizations. There were 11.8/10,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations (7% of hospitalizations). RSV and influenza detection peaked in winter (November-February) and rainy seasons (July), respectively. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were associated with a substantial proportion of hospitalizations among young children in a rural Indian community. Public health research and prevention in India should consider targeting RSV and influenza in young children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global burden of influenza is increasingly recognized, but data from India remain sparse. We conducted a multi-site population-based surveillance study to estimate and compare rates of influenza-associated hospitalization at two rural Indian health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) sites at Ballabgarh and Vadu during 2010-2012. METHODS: Prospective facility-based surveillance for all hospitalizations (excluding those for trauma, elective surgery and obstetric, ophthalmic or psychiatric reasons) was conducted at 72 health facilities. After collection of clinical details, patients had nasopharyngeal swabs taken and tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza viruses. Annual healthcare utilization surveys (HUS) were conducted in HDSS households to identify proportion of hospitalizations occurring at non-study facilities to adjust for hospitalizations missed through facility-based surveillance. RESULTS: HUS showed that 69% and 67% of hospitalizations occurred at study facilities at Ballabgarh and Vadu, respectively. Overall, 6004 patients hospitalized with acute medical illness at participating facilities were enrolled (1717 from Ballabgarh; 4287 from Vadu). The proportion of patients with influenza was higher at Vadu than Ballabgarh annually (2010: 21% vs. 5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 2011: 18% vs. 5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 2012: 23% vs. 5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Annual adjusted influenza-associated hospitalization rates were 5-11 fold higher in Vadu (20.3-51.6 per 10,000) vs Ballabgarh (4.4-6.3 per 10,000). At both sites, influenza A/H1N1pdm09 and B predominated during 2010, A/H3N2 and B during 2011, and A/H1N1pdm09 and B during 2012. CONCLUSION: The markedly different influenza hospitalization rates by season and across communities in India highlight the need for sustained multi-site surveillance system for estimating national influenza disease burden. That would be the first step for initiating discussions around Influenza prevention and control strategies in the country.",

        "abstract": "The burden of disease due to influenza is not well characterized for children in developing countries and the effectiveness of available influenza vaccines in lower resource settings has not been established. We initiated a prospective, longitudinal, phase IV, household-randomized, controlled, observer-blinded three year study (2009-2011) in a rural community of India to measure the total and indirect household protective effects of immunizing children ages 6 months through 10 years with seasonal inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) or a control vaccine (n=3697). Active weekly surveillance was conducted year round with home visits for identification of febrile acute respiratory illness (FARI) conducted for all vaccine recipients and household members (n=18,220). Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each FARI episode for influenza detection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was reduction in laboratory confirmed influenza infections in the influenza vaccine versus control vaccine group, with secondary outcome assessing indirect effects among the entire study population. This report describes the study site, cluster study design, choice of study and control vaccines, and the initial enrollment in the study.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Most studies on the clinical presentation with influenza viruses have been conducted in outpatient or inpatient medical facilities with only a few studies in community settings. Clinical differences between influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09 and influenza B virus infections have importance for community-based public health surveillance. An active community surveillance at the time of emergence of pandemic influenza provided us with an opportunity to compare the clinical features among patients infected with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus and those with influenza B virus co-circulating in an active community-based weekly surveillance in three villages in Faridabad, Haryana, north India. METHODS: Active surveillance for febrile acute respiratory infection (FARI) was carried out in a rural community (n=16,182) in the context of an inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine trial (among children <11 yr). Individuals with FARI were assessed clinically by nurses and respiratory samples collected and tested for influenza viruses by real time RT-PCR from November 2009 to August 2010. Clinical symptoms of patients with influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09 and influenza B infection were compared. RESULTS: Of the 4796 samples tested, 822 (17%) were positive for influenza virus. Of these, 443 (54%) were influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, 373 (45%) were influenza B and six were other subtypes/mixed infections. The mean age was lower for patients with influenza B (16.4 yr) than influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection (18.7 yr; P=0.04). Among children aged 5-18 yr, chills/rigours (OR 4.0; CI 2.2, 7.4), sore throat (OR 6.8; CI 2.3, 27.3) and headache (OR2.0; CI 1.3, 3.3) were more common in influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection than in influenza B cases. Chills/rigours (OR 2.4; CI 1.4, 4.0) and headache (OR 1.7; CI 1.0, 2.7) were associated with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection in those >18 yr. No significant differences were seen in children <5 yr. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the differences in the clinical presentation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B infections are not likely to be of clinical or public health significance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hygiene-related practices of women during menstruation are of paramount importance. There is a lack of sizeable literature on menstrual practices from northern India. We documented the menstrual hygiene practices of rural women and assessed their willingness to pay for sanitary napkins. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in villages under the Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project (CRHSP), situated in Ballabgarh, Haryana. The study participants were women in the age group of 15-45 years. Nine villages were selected randomly while the number of respondents in each selected village was decided through the probability propor-tionate to size sampling method. The households were selected using systematic sampling. One woman was interviewed in each household using a pre-tested questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 995 women were interviewed. A majority of them (62%) were unaware of the reason(s) for menstruation. The role of the health sector in providing information regarding menstruation was low as only a few women (1.5%) had got information from the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM)/health worker (HW). For the majority of women, besides religious activities, other routine activities did not suffer during menstruation. Only 28.8% of women were using sanitary napkins and of those who did not use napkins, only one-fourth (25.3%) were willing to buy them. The mean (SD) price per napkin that these women were ready to pay was Rs. 0.54 (0.43), equivalent to US$ 0.01. CONCLUSION: Women in the reproductive age group should be provided with appropriate information about menstruation, and they should be told about the advantages of using sanitary napkins. Health sector functionaries should play a proactive role in the delivery of such information.",

Periodic situational analysis with contextual relevance and interpretation of outcomes was done pertaining to national goals and international standards. <b>Results:</b> The NEB and cornea services have played a key leadership role in furthering the development of eye banking and corneal transplantation services. The contribution extends beyond routine patient care to education, training, generation of resources, advocacy, and policymaking. In quantifiable terms, the overall performance has steadily increased over the years. Major contributions include training of doctors, eye bank staff and corneal surgeons, introduction of innovative techniques for corneal transplantation, setting of national standards for eye banking and provision of preservation media, customized corneal, and ocular surface cell replacement therapy in collaboration with other departments and institutes. <b>Conclusion:</b> The eye banking and corneal transplantation facilities have evolved with time providing quality services, modernized as appropriate with updated knowledge and incorporating technological advances supported by the systematic evidence-based approach.",

        "abstract": "<b>Aim:</b> To estimate the prevalence of visual impairment (VI) due to uncorrected refractive error (URE) and to assess the barriers to utilization of services in the adult urban population of Delhi. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A population-based rapid assessment of VI was conducted among people aged 40 years and above in 24 randomly selected clusters of East Delhi district. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) was assessed in each eye using Snellen's E chart. Pinhole examination was done if PVA was <20/60 in either eye and ocular examination to ascertain the cause of VI. Barriers to utilization of services for refractive error were recorded with questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> Of 2421 individuals enumerated, 2331 (96%) individuals were examined. Females were 50.7% among them. The mean age of all examined subjects was 51.32 \u00b1 10.5 years (standard deviation). VI in either eye due to URE was present in 275 individuals (11.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.5-13.1). URE was identified as the most common cause (53.4%) of VI. The overall prevalence of VI due to URE in the study population was 6.1% (95% CI: 5.1-7.0). The elder population as well as females were more likely to have VI due to URE (odds ratio [OR] = 12.3; <i>P</i> < 0.001 and OR = 1.5; <i>P</i> < 0.02). Lack of felt need was the most common reported barrier (31.5%). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of VI due to URE among the urban adult population of Delhi is still high despite the availability of abundant eye care facilities. The majority of reported barriers are related to human behavior and attitude toward the refractive error. Understanding these aspects will help in planning appropriate strategies to eliminate VI due to URE.",

Major components of INY package include an unrestricted diet of foods in natural form, daily yogic exercises, meditation for relaxation, patient counselling and health education in a highly structured routine for 15 days. We aimed to determine if INY reduced blood pressure and the need of anti-hypertensive medications in hypertensive patients. Design Observational cohort study involving pre\u2013post-comparative analysis of patients enrolled between April and July 2015. Blood pressure, anthropometry, blood parameters and compliance to diet and yoga (diet and yoga score on a scale of 0\u201310) were measured at baseline and 3 months. Results Of 104 patients, 80 (77%) had 3-month follow-up. Of them, 79 (99%) achieved target BP control (&lt;140/90 mmHg) and 66 (83%) achieved this with &gt;50% reduction in antihypertensive medication dose, and in 8 (10%) patients, all medications were withdrawn. There was a significant increase in diet (2.7\u20137.4), yoga scores (1.5\u20135.6) and decrease in body weight, body fat, blood triglycerides and glycosylated haemoglobin levels. Conclusion These early results are promising and need further study with long-term follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Background Worldwide, there\u2019s concern over high pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attritions or delays in Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) diagnosis and treatment pathway (DTP). We conducted this operational research among patients with presumptive MDR-TB in north and central Chennai, India to determine attrition and turnaround times (TAT) at various steps of DTP and factors associated with attrition. Methods Study was conducted in Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme setting. It was a retrospective cohort study involving record review of all patients with presumptive MDR-TB (eligible for DST) in 2014. Results Of 628 eligible for DST, 557 (88%) underwent DST and 74 (13%) patients were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition was 11% (71/628) and 38% (28/74) respectively. TAT [median (IQR)] to test from eligibility for DST and initiate DR-TB treatment from diagnosis were 14 (9,27) and 18 (13,36) days respectively. Patients with smear negative TB and detected in first quarter of 2014 were less likely to undergo DST. Patients in first quarter of 2014 had significantly lower risk of pre-treatment attrition. Conclusion There was high uptake of DST. However, urgent attention is required to reduce pre-treatment attrition, improve TAT to test from eligibility for DST and improve DST among patients with smear-negative TB.",

Direct (medical and non-medical) and indirect costs due to TB diagnosis were collected through patient interviews at their residence. We defined costs due to TB diagnosis as \u2018catastrophic\u2019 if the total costs (direct and indirect) due to TB diagnosis exceeded 20% of annual pre-TB household income. We used concentration curves and indices to assess the extent of inequity.Results: When compared with patients detected through PCF (n = 231), ACF patients (n = 234) incurred lower median total costs (US$ 4.6 and 20.4, p < 0.001). The prevalence of catastrophic costs in ACF and PCF was 10.3 and 11.5% respectively. Adjusted analysis showed that patients detected through ACF had a 32% lower prevalence of catastrophic costs relative to PCF [adjusted prevalence ratio (95% CI): 0.68 (0.69, 0.97)]. The concentration indices (95% CI) for total costs in both ACF [\u22120.15 (\u22120.32, 0.11)] and PCF [\u22120.06 (\u22120.20, 0.08)] were not significantly different from the line of equality and each other. The concentration indices (95% CI) for catastrophic costs in both ACF [\u22120.60 (\u22120.81, \u20130.39)] and PCF [\u22120.58 (\u22120.78, \u20130.38)] were not significantly different from each other: however, both the curves had a significant distribution among the poorest quintiles.Conclusion: ACF among marginalised and vulnerable populations reduced total costs and prevalence of catastrophic costs due to TB diagnosis, but could not address inequity.",

        "abstract": "<br><b>Purpose:</b> In India, teachers screen middle school children using the 6/9 Snellen's optotype. Recently, the National Program for Control of Blindness included primary school students also. The present cross-sectional study was planned to assess the inclusion of primary school students. Compliance to spectacles was ascertained after 6 months follow-up. <b>Methods:</b> Randomly selected 23 Government primary schools. A total of 30 teachers were nominated and given hands-on training in vision screening and recording formats. Teachers conducted vision screening of primary school students of their respective schools using the 6/12 Snellen's chart and referred students with subnormal vision to optometrist. Optometrist also validated the screening done by teachers. Optometrist screened the vision of 5% randomly selected children screened by teachers as having normal vision. Descriptive statistics used STATA version 13.0. <b>Results:</b> A total of 6056 students screened by the teachers. Sensitivity and specificity of teacher screening were 92.3% (confidence interval [CI] 88.6\u201395.0) and 72.6% (CI 68.2\u201376.6)), respectively. About 277 students underwent refraction and 186 prescribed spectacles. The prevalence of myopia, hypermetropia, and astigmatism is 2.5% (2.1\u20132.9), 0.6% (0.4\u20130.8), and 1.3% (1.0\u20131.6), respectively. Compliance to spectacles usage is 36%. <b>Conclusion:</b> Burden of refractive error in primary school is very low. Trained teachers can identify children with subnormal vision, but the false-positive rate is very high. Compliance to spectacle use among primary school children is also less. Vision screening by teachers prioritized in secondary schools and preschool screening should be done by more skilled eye care workers preferably optometrist.<br>",

Online search of peer-reviewed scientific published literature and guidelines using PubMed, the World Health Organization (WHO) IRIS, and Google Scholar with keywords, namely blindness and visual impairment, along with offline examination of reports of national and international organizations, as well as their cross-references was done until December 2016, to identify relevant documents on the definition of blindness. The evidence for the historical and currently adopted definition of blindness under the NPCB, the WHO, and other countries was reviewed. Differences in the NPCB and WHO definitions were analyzed to assess the impact on the epidemiological status of blindness and visual impairment in India. The differences in the criteria for blindness under the NPCB and the WHO definitions cause an overestimation of the prevalence of blindness in India. These variations are also associated with an over-representation of refractive errors as a cause of blindness and an under-representation of other causes under the NPCB definition. The targets for achieving elimination of blindness also become much more difficult to achieve under the NPCB definition. Ignoring differences in definitions when comparing the global and Indian prevalence of blindness will cause erroneous interpretations. We recommend that the appropriate modifications should be made in the NPCB definition of blindness to make it consistent with the WHO definition.",

        "abstract": "Background: In 2007, a field observation from India reported 11% misclassification among \u2018new\u2019 patients registered under the revised national tuberculosis (TB) control programme. Ten years down the line, it is important to know what proportion of newly registered patients has a past history of TB treatment for at least one month (henceforth called \u2018misclassification\u2019). Methods: A study was conducted among new smear-positive pulmonary TB patients registered between March 2016 and February 2017 in 18 randomly selected districts to determine the effectiveness of an active case-finding strategy in marginalised and vulnerable populations. We included all patients detected through active case-finding. An equal number of randomly selected patients registered through passive case-finding from marginalised and vulnerable populations in the same districts were included. Before enrolment, we enquired about any history of previous TB treatment through interviews. Results: Of 629 patients, we interviewed 521, of whom, 11% (n=56) had past history of TB treatment (public or private) for at least a month: 13% (34/268) among the active case-finding group and 9% (22/253) among the passive case-finding group (p=0.18). No factors were found to be significantly associated with misclassification. Conclusion: Around one in every ten patients registered as \u2018new\u2019 had previous history of TB treatment. Corrective measures need to be implemented, followed by monitoring of any change in the proportion of \u2018previously treated\u2019 patients among all registered patients treated under the programme at national level.",

        "title": "Efficacy of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine in rural India: a 3-year cluster-randomised controlled trial",
        "abstract": "<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Paediatric vaccination against influenza can result in indirect protection, by reducing transmission to their unvaccinated contacts. We investigated whether influenza vaccination of children would protect them and their household members in a resource-limited setting.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We did a cluster-randomised, blinded, controlled study in three villages in India. Clusters were defined as households (ie, dwellings that shared a courtyard), and children aged 6 months to 10 years were eligible for vaccination as and when they became age-eligible throughout the study. Households were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-based system to intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or a control of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the beginning of the study; vaccination occurred once a year for 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza in a vaccinated child with febrile acute respiratory illness, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, children who received at least one dose of vaccine, were under surveillance, and had not an influenza infection within 15 days of last vaccine dose). The secondary outcome for indirect effectiveness (surveillance study) was febrile acute respiratory illness in an unvaccinated household member of a vaccine study participant. Data from each year (year 1: November, 2009, to October, 2010; year 2: October, 2010, to October, 2011; and year 3: October, 2011, to May, 2012) were analysed separately. Safety was analysed among all participants who were vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00934245.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Between Nov 1, 2009, to May 1, 2012, we enrolled 3208 households, of which 1959 had vaccine-eligible children. 1010 households were assigned to IIV3 and 949 households were assigned to IPV. In 3 years, we vaccinated 4345 children (2132 with IIV3 and 2213 with IPV) from 1868 households (968 with IIV3 and 900 with IPV) with 10 813 unvaccinated household contacts. In year 1, influenza virus was detected in 151 (10%) of 1572 IIV3 recipients and 206 (13%) of 1633 of IPV recipients (total IIV3 vaccine efficacy 25\u00b76% [95% CI 6\u00b78\u201340\u00b76]; p=0\u00b7010). In year 2, 105 (6%) of 1705 IIV3 recipients and 182 (10%) of 1814 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 41\u00b70% [24\u00b71\u201354\u00b71]; p<0\u00b70001). In year 3, 20 (1%) of 1670 IIV3 recipients and 81 (5%) of 1786 IPV recipients had influenza (vaccine efficacy 74\u00b72% [57\u00b78\u201384\u00b73]; p<0\u00b70001). In year 1, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 14\u00b75% (\u201320\u00b74 to 39\u00b73). In year 2, total vaccine efficacy against influenza A(H3N2) was 64\u00b75% (48\u00b75\u201375\u00b75). Total vaccine efficacy against influenza B was 32\u00b75% (11\u00b73\u201348\u00b76) in year 1, 4\u00b79% (\u201338\u00b79 to 34\u00b79) in year 2, and 76\u00b75% (59\u00b74\u201386\u00b74) in year 3. Indirect vaccine effectiveness was statistically significant only in year 3 (38\u00b71% [7\u00b74\u201358\u00b76], p=0\u00b70197) when influenza was detected in 39 (1%) of 4323 IIV3-allocated and 60 (1%) of 4121 IPV-allocated household unvaccinated individuals. In the IIV3 group, 225 (12%) of 1632 children in year 1, 375 (22%) of 1718 in year 2, and 209 (12%) of 1673 in year 3 had an adverse reaction (compared with 216 [13%] of 1730, 380 [21%] of 1825, and 235 [13%] of 1796, respectively, in the IPV group). The most common reactions in both groups were fever and tenderness at site. No vaccine-related deaths occurred in either group.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>IIV3 provided variable direct and indirect protection against influenza infection. Indirect protection was significant during the year of highest direct protection and should be considered when quantifying the effect of vaccination programmes.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>",

        "title": "Spectacle Coverage among Urban School children with Refractive Error Provided Subsidized Spectacles in North India",
        "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE\u00a0Provision of subsidized spectacles to schoolchildren with refractive error in Delhi was associated with increased spectacle coverage. PURPOSE\u00a0Studies involving free spectacle distribution and self-purchase of spectacles often report poor compliance. We assessed 1-year spectacle coverage among schoolchildren with refractive error who were provided subsidized spectacles. METHODS\u00a0This was a study of a prospective cohort of 10,114 students from 20 randomly selected schools of Delhi. Children were presumed to have refractive error when unaided visual acuity was worse than or equal to 6/12 in either eye and a best-corrected visual acuity better than or equal to 6/9.5 in both eyes (n = 1503). Children with unmet need of spectacles (presenting with a visual acuity worse than 6/9.5 in the worse eye) were provided subsidized spectacles (n = 1191). Coverage was established by direct observation at baseline and after 1 year through unannounced visits. RESULTS\u00a0Mean age of cohort was 12.0 \u00b1 2.0 years, and 566 (37.7%) were girls. Baseline spectacle coverage was 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.1 to 31.7%), which improved to 65.9% (95% CI, 56.0 to 61.6%) among all children (n = 1470) and 58.8% (95% CI, 56.0 to 61.6%) among children with unmet need (n = 1163) at 1 year. Uptake of the subsidized spectacles was 98.6%. On multivariate regression, the odds of spectacle use were greatest when unaided vision was poor: 55.5% when visual acuity was better than or equal to 6/9.5, 74.8% when visual acuity was 6/19 to 6/60 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.5), and 91.5% when visual acuity was worse than 6/60 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 9.5). Sex (boys, 66.3%; girls, 65.3%) and socioeconomic status (lower, 58.6%; middle, 61.8%; upper middle, 70.7%) were not associated with coverage. Increasing maternal education and baseline spectacle use were associated with coverage. However, 38.0% were wearing spectacles prescribed by the project, and 61.9% of the spectacles being used at 1 year were purchased in the open market. CONCLUSIONS\u00a0Spectacle coverage after 1 year increased through a subsidized spectacle scheme, particularly for children with poor uncorrected vision.",

        "abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> An Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) available in community could be a potential primary eye care (PEC) worker. Training programme for ASHAs on PEC was undertaken & evaluated in a district of a capital city. <b>Methods:</b> ASHAs selected randomly from a district were imparted one day training on PEC & expected to refer patients to nearby Vision Centres (VC). Their knowledge was assessed before & after training and re-evaluated 1 year later. ASHAs were asked to conduct vision screening of 40+ population in their areas and ASHA referrals were noted by Optometrist in VC. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) of ASHAs were held to find barriers & facilitating factors in engaging ASHAs in PEC. Training was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's evaluation model for measuring reactions, learning, behaviour and results. <b>Results:</b> Mean knowledge score increased from 14.96 (\u00b14.34) pre-training to 25.38 (\u00b13.48) post- training and sustained at 21.75 (\u00b14.16) at 1year. Monthly average OPD of vision centres increased by 23.6% after ASHA training. FGDs revealed that ASHAs were willing to work in eye care for awareness generation and patient facilitation but were hesitant in conducting vision screening. <b>Conclusion:</b> ASHAs can be trained as PEC workers provided they have adequate support.",

This contribution of household transmission to overall TB transmission provides evidence for a potential population-level benefit of TB preventive treatment for all household contacts (without active TB). Females with TB had a significantly higher household TB exposure than males. Targeted TB preventive treatment (if implemented in a phased manner) among female household contacts may be explored after considering other factors.",

        "abstract": "Childhood blindness is one of the priority targets of Vision 2020\u2014Right To Sight due to its impact on the psychological and social growth of the child. An extensive search was performed to locate research papers on childhood blindness prevalence and its causes in the community based and blind schools, respectively, conducted from 1990 onward up to the present. Cross references were also manually searched along with expert consultation to enlarge the reference data. A total of five community-based studies on the prevalence including two refractive error studies conducted all over India in children less than 16 years were found. The causes of childhood blindness from the available blind school studies revealed that causes of childhood blindness have mainly shifted from corneal causes to whole globe abnormalities. This article highlights that though with the availability of proper healthcare facilities, the trend is changing for the causes but still a lot of effort in the form of timely neonatal eye care facilities, pediatric surgical services and proper refraction strategies is required.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To objectively assess recovery of thumb opposition in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after open carpal tunnel release and to evaluate electrophysiological and magnetic resonance (MR) neurography findings as predictors of thumb opposition recovery. METHODS: A total of 22 patients with severe CTS and thenar atrophy were included in this study. A detailed clinical, electrophysiological, and MR neurography evaluation was done both before and after surgery at 6 months to assess thumb opposition recovery. RESULTS: The median duration of symptoms was 12 months (interquartile range, 12-20 months). The compound muscle action potential of the abductor pollisis brevis (CMAP-APB) also\u00a0showed statistically significant improvement of 0.5\u00a0+ 0.2 mV after surgery. Tip-tip pulp pinch strength increased from 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 to 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 kg at 6-month follow-up, lateral pulp pinch strength increased from 1.9 \u00b1 0.6 to 2.8 \u00b1 0.9 kg at 6-month follow-up, and 3-point pulp pinch also improved from 1.9 \u00b1 0.5 to 2.8 \u00b1 0.9 at final follow-up. On MR neurogram, the proportion of patients with abnormal median nerve morphology decreased from 81.8% to 68.2%, abnormal thenar branch morphology decreased from 63.6% to 36.4% and denervation edema deceased from 59.1% to 13.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from severe CTS with thenar atrophy and detectable CMAP-APB showed promising improvement following open carpal tunnel release.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Most studies on opioid agonist treatment (OAT) from South Asia have assessed retention over short term. The aim of this study was to assess retention rates on buprenorphine-based OAT in a community clinic at 6 years, and to assess factors associated with long-term retention. Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Consecutive case records of patients with opioid dependence syndrome (as per International Classification of Diseases, Version 10) started on buprenorphine from 2005 to 2007 were reviewed for 6 years after an individual\u2019s initiation on buprenorphine. Multi-variate logistic regression and odd\u2019s ratio was used to assess variables that could predict retention to buprenorphine. Results: The OAT retention rate of 150 participants by the sixth year was 36%. Mean dose of buprenorphine was 6.4 milligram per day (SD: 2.3). Opioid withdrawals (OR: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01\u20130.52), concomitant opioid use (OR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0\u20130.14), and visits to counselor (OR: 0.1, 95%CI: 0.01\u20130.87) predicted poor retention to buprenorphine maintenance. Improved occupational functioning (OR: 14.08, 95%CI: 4.62\u201342.93) significantly predicted OAT retention. Adjusting for other variables, illicit opioid use (OR: 0.04, 95%CI: 0\u20130.37) negatively predicted, while improved occupational functioning (OR: 12.96, 95%CI: 3.43\u201348.91) positively predicted retention. Conclusion: Patients have fairly good long-term retention rates on OAT with buprenorphine in community-based setting. Maintaining abstinence and improved occupational functioning improve buprenorphine retention.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system, including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In this study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs. Methods: Following the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many visually challenged students (VCS) were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for telefacilities. The intended services were explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information. Results: As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear among VCS during the pandemic.",

As the health-care system is finally re-organizing to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, it was necessary to re-structure primary eye care (PEC) activities as well on the same lines. A consensus meeting was held with leading eye-care experts on 2nd May 2020 to prepare a roadmap for PEC in the days to come. Guidelines are needed for PEC activities like vision testing, refraction, optical dispensing, counseling, etc., Some of the activities at vision centers (VCs) may be postponed or modified in light of the current pandemic situation. PEC workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms (minimum 3 feet) for minimizing risk of exposure and need access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, masks and shields while examining beneficiaries. For optometrists, sterilization of instruments and encouraging the people to remain silent during the examination is recommended. Because conjunctivitis may be an early sign which can present at VCs, extra precautions in the form of PPE has to be ensured while examining such patients. This is also an opportunity to start running telemedicine clinics for all emergent cases that cannot be managed at the primary level. The guidelines also need to be updated based on the context of the working environment and changes in government directives from time to time.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence and determine risk factors for dry eye disease (DED) in geographically diverse regions of India. METHOD: A population based cross-sectional study was conducted on people aged \u226540 years in plain, hilly and coastal areas. Dry eye assessment by objective [tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I, corneal staining] and subjective [Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)] parameters was performed with questionnaire-based assessment of exposure to sunlight, cigarette smoke, indoor smoke. The prevalence of DED with age, sex, occupation, location, smoking, exposure to sunlight, indoor smoke, diabetes, hypertension, was subjected to logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 9,735 people (age 54.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 years; range 40-99, males 45.5%) were included. The prevalence of DED was 26.2%, was higher in plains (41.3%) compared to hilly (24.0%) and coastal area (9.9%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and increased with age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), female gender (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), smoking (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), indoor smoke (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), diabetes (p-0.02), hypertension (0.001), occupations with predominant outdoor activity (p-0.013) and increasing exposure to sunlight (trend). Multi-logistic regression showed a positive association with female sex (OR-1.2, CI-1.01, 1.4), exposure to indoor smoke (OR-1.3, CI-1.1, 1.5), smoking (OR-1.2; CI-1.03, 1.3), prolonged exposure to sunlight (OR-1.8, CI-1.5, 2.2), hypertension (OR 1.3, CI-1.2, 1.4), diabetes (OR-1.2, CI-1, 1.5) and negative association with region - hilly (OR-0.5, CI-0.4, 0.6) and coastal (OR-0.2; CI-0.1, 0.2), and BMI (OR-0.8, CI-0.7, 0.9). CONCLUSION: DED is common in population \u226540 years of age. Its prevalence is affected by extrinsic (geographic location, exposure to sunlight, smoking, indoor smoke) and intrinsic (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI) factors.",

        "abstract": "While risk of tuberculosis (TB) is high among household contacts (HHCs) of pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR-TB, data on yield of systematic longitudinal screening are lacking. We aim to describe the yield of systematic longitudinal TB contact tracing among HHCs of patients with pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB. At the M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) clinic, Mumbai, India a cohort comprising 518 HHCs of 109 pre-XDR and XDR index cases was enrolled between January 2016 and June 2018. Regular HHC follow-ups were done till one year post treatment of index cases. Of 518 HHCs, 23 had TB (21 on TB treatment and two newly diagnosed) at the time of first visit. Of the rest, 19% HHCs had no follow-ups. Fourteen (3.5%) TB cases were identified among 400 HHCs; incidence rate: 2072/100,000 person-years (95% CI: 1227&ndash;3499). The overall yield of household contact tracing was 3% (16/518). Of 14 who were diagnosed with TB during follow-up, six had drug susceptible TB (DSTB); six had pre-XDR-TB and one had XDR-TB. Five of fourteen cases had resistance patterns concordant with their index case. In view of the high incidence of TB among HHCs of pre-XDR and XDR-TB cases, follow-up of HHCs for at least the duration of index cases&rsquo; treatment should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Background: Following data access and storage concerns, Government of India transferred the management of its Sample Registration System (SRS) based mortality surveillance (formerly known as the Million Death Study) to an Indian agency. This paper introduces the new system, challenges it faced and its vision for future. Methods: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, the new nodal agency, established the \"Mortality in India Established through Verbal Autopsy\" (MINErVA) platform with state level partners across India in November 2017. The network in its first three years has undertaken capacity building of supervisors conducting verbal autopsy under the SRS, established a panel of trained physician reviewers and developed three IT-based platforms for training, quality control and coding. Coding of VA forms started from January 2015 onwards, and the cause specific mortality fractions (CSMF) of the first 14\u2009185 adult verbal autopsy (VA) records for 2015 were compared with earlier published data for 2010-2013 to check for continuity of system performance. Results: The network consists of 25 institutions and a panel of 676 trained physician reviewers. 916 supervisors have been trained in conducting verbal autopsies. More than 75\u2009000 VA forms have been coded to date. The median time taken for finalizing cause of death on the coding platform is 37 days. The level of physician agreement (67%) and proportion of VA forms requiring adjudication (12%) are consistent with published literature. Preliminary CSMF estimates for 2015 were comparable with those for 2010-2013 and identified same top ten causes of death. In addition to the delay, two major challenges identified for coding were language proficiency of physician reviewers vis-\u00e0-vis language of narratives and quality of verbal autopsies. While an initial strategic decision was made to consolidate the system to ensure continuity, future vision of the network is to move towards technology-based solutions including electronic data capture of VAs and its analysis and improving the use of mortality data in decision making. Conclusion: MINErVA network is now fully functional and is moving towards achieving global standards. It provides valuable lessons for other developing countries to establish their own mortality surveillance systems.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To determine the prevalence of cataract and its association with sun exposure and other environmental risk factors in three different geographically diverse populations of India. Design Population based cross sectional study during 2010\u20132016 Participants People aged \u2265 40 years residing in randomly sampled villages were enumerated (12021) and 9735 (81%) underwent ophthalmic evaluation from plains, hilly and coastal regions (3595, 3231, 2909 respectively) Methods A detailed questionnaire-based interview about outdoor activity in present, past and remote past, usage of sun protective measures, exposure to smoke, and detailed ophthalmic examination including assessment of uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure, slit lamp examination, lens opacities categorization using LOCS III and posterior segment evaluation was done. Lifetime effective sun exposure was calculated using Melbourne formula and expressed as quintiles. These were supplemented with physical environmental measurements. Main outcome measures Lifetime sun exposure hours, smoking, indoor kitchen smoke exposure and their association with cataract and subtypes. Prevalence of cataract calculated based on lens opacities or evidence of cataract surgery. Results Cataract was identified in 3231 (33.3%) participants. Prevalence of cataract in males (32.3%) and females (34.1%) was similar. Nuclear cataract was the commonest sub-type identified in 94.7% of affected eyes. Sun exposure had a significant association with cataract with odds ratio (OR) increasing from 1.6 (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: 1.4, 1.9) in 3rd quintile, to 2.6 (CI: 2.2, 3.1) in 4th quintile and 9.4 (CI: 7.9, 11.2) in 5th quintile (p<0.0001). Cataract also showed a significant association with smoking (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.2, 1.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.0\u20131.4). Nuclear cataract showed a positive association with increasing sun exposure in 3rd (\u03b2 coefficient 0.5, CI:0.2\u20130.7), 4th (\u03b2: 0.9, CI: 0.7\u20131.1) and 5th (\u03b2: 2.1, CI:1.8\u20132.4) quintiles of sun exposure, smoking (\u03b2: 0.4, CI: 0.2\u20130.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (\u03b2: 0.3, CI: 01\u20130.5) while cortical cataract showed a positive association with sun exposure only in 5th quintile (\u03b2: 2.6, CI:1.0\u20134.2). Posterior subcapsular cataract was not associated with any of the risk factors. Conclusion Cataract is associated with increasing level of sun exposure, smoking and exposure to indoor kitchen smoke.",

        "abstract": "Background India is the second most populated country in the world with 41% of the population (492 million) under 18 years of age. While numerous studies have shown an increasing prevalence of myopia worldwide, there continues to be uncertainty about the magnitude of myopia in Indian school going population. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We systematically identified published literature of last four decades from 1980 to March 2020 and assessed them for methodological quality. Data were gathered into 5-year age groups from 5\u201315, in urban or rural populations, and standardized to definition of myopia as refractive error \u2265 -0.50 dioptre. Random effects meta-analysis was done. Results We included data from 59 quality assessed studies, covering nearly 1,66,000 urban and 1,20,000 rural children. The overall crude prevalence of myopia over last four decades is 7.5% (95% CI, 6.5\u20138.5%) in 5-15-year age group. The prevalence of myopia is 8.5% (95% CI, 7.1\u20139.9%) in urban and 6.1% (95% CI, 4.5\u20137.7%) in rural children, with highest prevalence in urban 11-15-year age group [15.0% in last decade]. A significant increment in prevalence is noted in the last decade in rural children from 4.6% to 6.8%, reflecting changing rural environment. Conclusion Myopia is an emerging public health problem in both urban and rural school going adolescents in India requiring urgent efforts.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The objective of the study was to assess the awareness and health-seeking practices related to cataract in urban slums of Delhi. Methods: This study design was a population-based cross-sectional study. Participants aged 18\u201360 years were recruited from randomly selected five slums of South Delhi. They were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule on awareness and eye health-seeking practices related to cataract. The practices were recorded if the respondents themselves or any other member of the family was diagnosed with cataract in previous 2 years. Results: A total of 1552 respondents participated in the study, of which, 89.9% had heard of cataract but only (42%) were aware of any symptom of cataract. The common symptoms of cataract reported by the participants were white opacity in eyes (25.9%) and loss of vision (20.6%). Surgery as a treatment of cataract was known to only 559 (40.1%) participants. Awareness about surgery as treatment of cataract was significantly higher among people aged 45\u201360 years (adjusted odds ratio = 2.89, 95% confidence interval = 2.11\u20133.97) and in educated people (adjusted OR = 3.69 95% CI = 2.37\u20135.73). Out of 84 respondents who had been diagnosed with cataract, the health-seeking practices were observed by 70 (83.3%) participants. Among them, 51 (72.9%) had undergone surgery and another 19 (27.1%) had been advised to wait for surgery. Most of the operated patients 48 (94.1%) attended the postoperative follow-up. Conclusion: The study findings suggest the majority of participants have heard of cataract, but there is low awareness of its symptoms and treatment, and good eye health-seeking practices observed for cataract in urban slum population. Gaps in awareness observed can be filled up by implementing proper eye health education programs.",

        "abstract": "Objective To estimate rates of community-level influenza-like-illness (ILI) and influenza-associated ILI in rural north India. Methods During 2011, we conducted household-based healthcare utilization surveys (HUS) for any acute medical illness (AMI) in preceding 14days among residents of 28villages of Ballabgarh, in north India. Concurrently, we conducted clinic-based surveillance (CBS) in the area for AMI episodes with illness onset \u22643days and collected nasal and throat swabs for influenza virus testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Retrospectively, we applied ILI case definition (measured/reported fever and cough) to HUS and CBS data. We attributed 14days of risk-time per person surveyed in HUS and estimated community ILI rate by dividing the number of ILI cases in HUS by total risk-time. We used CBS data on influenza positivity and applied it to HUS-based community ILI rates by age, month, and clinic type, to estimate the community influenza-associated ILI rates. Findings The HUS of 69,369 residents during the year generated risk-time of 3945 person-years (p-y) and identified 150 (5%, 95%CI: 4\u20136) ILI episodes (38 ILI episodes/1,000 p-y; 95% CI 32\u201344). Among 1,372 ILI cases enrolled from clinics, 126 (9%; 95% CI 8\u201311) had laboratory-confirmed influenza (A (H3N2) = 72; B = 54). After adjusting for age, month, and clinic type, overall influenza-associated ILI rate was 4.8/1,000 p-y; rates were highest among children <5 years (13; 95% CI: 4\u201329) and persons\u226560 years (11; 95%CI: 2\u201330). Conclusion We present a novel way to use HUS and CBS data to generate estimates of community burden of influenza. Although the confidence intervals overlapped considerably, higher point estimates for burden among young children and older adults shows the utility for exploring the value of influenza vaccination among target groups.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: : To explore the role of outdoor light exposure by estimating ocular sun exposure measured by Conjunctival Ultraviolet Autofluorescence (CUVAF) imaging and serum melatonin levels in myopes and non-myopes. MATERIALS & METHODS: Age and sex matched emmetropes and myopes (60 each) aged 10-25\u00a0years participated. Those with history of ocular surgery or any ocular or systemic co-morbidity were excluded. Socio-demographic parameters, sun exposure questionnaires, indoor and outdoor activity profile, morning serum melatonin levels, sleep pattern, degree of myopia, ocular biometry and area of CUVAF on ultraviolet photography were noted and analysed. RESULTS: Mean age of myopes (18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5 years) and emmetropes (18.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years) was similar (P\u00a0=\u00a0.523). Serum melatonin levels were significantly higher (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) among myopes (89.45\u00a0pg/ml) as compared to emmetropes (52.83\u00a0pg/ml). Lifetime sun exposure was significantly lower in myopes than emmetropes (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0003). Area of CUVAF was inversely related to degree of myopia (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Day time sleepiness was greater in myopes (51.7%) than emmetropes (15%) (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). There was a positive correlation between serum melatonin levels and axial length among myopes (correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.27; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Age and gender had no association with serum melatonin levels. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an inverse relationship between serum melatonin levels and degree of CUVAF in myopes. A novel link between serum melatonin, axial length and outdoor sun exposure is highlighted in the current study.",

        "title": "Turning a New Chapter in Neurosurgery Outpatient Services: Telemedicine A \"Savior\" in this Pandemic",
        "abstract": "Background: Teleconsultation services in India, especially in neurosurgery, are relatively new. Despite its large-scale adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive analyses of patients' perspectives and hurdles are lacking. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymized telephonic survey of consecutive neurosurgical patients who availed telemedicine services at our institute, using a validated, structured questionnaire. To prevent bias, interviewers were not involved in the study design/analyses. Patients' perception of usefulness and performance of teleconsultation was graded on a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Of the 330 patients who availed teleconsultation services, 231 (70%) completed the survey. Even though 91% of the respondents had access to a smartphone, only 10% received a video-based teleconsult. As per respondents, the challenges included poor network (7%), suboptimal communication/discussion (5.6%), lack of physical examination (6%), and misinterpretation of prescription by pharmacists/patients (6%). The majority of the respondents (58%) either agreed/strongly agreed that teleconsultation helped them tide over the medical exigency during the lockdown; however, the clinical diagnosis did not influence this response (P = 0.21). The vast majority of the respondents felt that teleconsultation is beneficial (97%), as it minimizes their exposure to COVID-19. One-third of the patients preferred this service over physical visits and 60% agreed to its continuation till resumption of routine care. Access to video-teleconsultation was the chief suggestion in 39 of 74 suggestions received. Conclusions: Telemedicine in neurosurgery offers favorable patient satisfaction during this pandemic and may be a satisfactory alternative to physical outpatient services in the future. Video-based teleconsults should be the preferred modality of communication for neurosurgery patients.",

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational. OBJECTIVES: (i) To develop a cross-culturally adapted Hindi translation of the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22r (refined) questionnaire and (ii) validate it in Hindi-speaking Indian patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). BACKGROUND DATA: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)-based questionnaires have superseded objective clinical and radiological measurements as tools to assess the outcome of health-related interventions. The SRS-22r is an extensively validated HRQoL-based questionnaire for AIS patients and has been adapted and translated in other languages. METHODOLOGY: A Hindi version of SRS-22r was developed in accordance with standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation. The final Hindi version was administered to 108 AIS patients. Subsequently, 58/108 patients answered the Hindi version again after 10-14\u00a0days. Another 50/108 bilingual patients answered the original English version after 10-14\u00a0days. In addition, 52/108 patients answered a previously validated Hindi version of Short Form (SF)-36 health survey. Content analysis, floor/ceiling effects, internal consistency, test/retest reproducibility and concurrent validity with the English version and the SF-36 questionnaire were determined for the Hindi version of SRS-22r. RESULTS: High ceiling effect was noted for the pain and satisfaction with management domains of Hindi version of SRS-22r. Overall internal consistency was good (Cronbach \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.77)-all domains, except the function domain (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.61) had good or excellent internal consistency. The test/retest reliability for all domains was excellent (intraclass coefficient/ICC\u2009>\u20090.80). The concurrent validity with the English version showed an excellent correlation for all domains (ICC\u2009>\u20090.80). Concurrent validity with SF-36 showed good correlation between relevant domains of SRS-22r and SF-36, except for the self-image and satisfaction with management domains of SRS-22r. CONCLUSION: Based on the results proving its reliability and validity, the adapted Hindi version of SRS-22r can be effectively used in Hindi-speaking, Indian AIS patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This was a population-based study to determine the prevalence and causes of visual impairment in children less than 16 years in Urban North India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 40 clusters of urban Delhi. 20,955 children aged less than 16 years underwent visual acuity screening using age-appropriate visual acuity charts. Unaided visual acuity of enumerated children aged over 2 years was assessed by using Lea symbols chart in 3-5 years age group and logMAR tumbling E charts for the 6-15 years age group. For children aged 0-2 years, fixation and following to torch light was assessed. All the children with unaided visual acuity of <6/12 in any eye in age group 3-15 years and inability to follow the light in age <3 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination. Results: Amongst 20,955 children examined for visual acuity a total of 789 children were referred to the central clinic for detailed ophthalmic examination. Of these referred children, a total of 124 had presenting visual acuity <6/18 in the better eye. The prevalence of visual impairment (VI) was 5.92 per thousand (95% CI: 4.96-7.05). The prevalence of moderate to severe visual impairment was maximum in the age group of 11 to 15 years. The main cause of avoidable VI in these children was a refractive error (75.7%). The prevalence of blindness was 0.42 per thousand. Conclusion: Optic nerve abnormalities were the most important cause of blindness in children. Refractive error is the most important cause of visual impairment amongst children and needs to be addressed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To quantify the prediagnostic loss to follow-up (PDLFU) in an active case finding tuberculosis (TB) programme and identify the barriers and enablers in undergoing diagnostic evaluation. DESIGN: Explanatory mixed-methods design. SETTING: A rural population of 1.02 million in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: Based on their knowledge of health status of families, community health workers or CHWs (called accredited social health activist or locally) and informal providers referred people to the programme. The field coordinators (FCs) in the programme screened the referrals for TB symptoms to identify presumptive TB cases. CHWs accompanied the presumptive TB patients to free diagnostic evaluation, and a transport allowance was given to the patients. Thereafter, CHWs initiated and supported the treatment of confirmed cases. We included 13 395 community referrals received between January and December 2018. To understand the reasons of the PDLFU, we conducted in-depth interviews with patients who were evaluated (n=3), patients who were not evaluated (n=4) and focus group discussions with the CHWs (n=2) and FCs (n=1). OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion and characteristics of PDLFU and association of demographic and symptom characteristics with diagnostic evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 11 146 presumptive TB cases were identified between January and December 2018, out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent diagnostic evaluation. In addition to the free TB services in the public sector, the key enablers were CHW accompaniment and support. The major barriers identified were misinformation and stigma, deficient family and health provider support, transport challenges and poor services in the public health system. CONCLUSION: Finding the missing cases will require patient-centric diagnostic services and urgent reform in the health system. A community-oriented intervention focusing on stigma, misinformation and patient support will be critical to its success.",

        "abstract": "Background: To understand the awareness and utilization of assistive technology in students at schools for the blind in Delhi.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among 250 students selected randomly from 10 blind schools in Delhi. Binocular distance presenting and pinhole vision acuity were assessed using Snellen \u201cE\u201d chart and a multiple pinhole occluder. Students were also interviewed using a questionnaire about 42 assistive devices to understand their awareness and use.Results: Male participants were 72.8%. Of the total, 27.6% students had best corrected visual acuity <6/18 to 1/60, and the rest had <1/60 vision. The awareness about tactile and sound-based technology was good among students: Braille books (98%), Braille slate and stylus (99.2%), handheld audio recorders (77.6%) and screen readers (77.2%). Good awareness was reported for abacus (88.8%), walking long canes (94.4%) and smart cane (89.6%), audible balls (96%), Braille chess (82.8%) and talking watch (98%). Among the students with <6/18 to 1/60 vision, the awareness of visual based technology ranged from 0.8% (typoscope) to 43.6% (video magnifiers). Braille technology was used for reading by 96.4% (books) and for writing by 96.8% (Braille slate and stylus) irrespective of visual status. Other devices were poorly used ranging from nil (typoscope) to 55% (screen readers). The use of math and science learning devices was poor (<20%). Walking canes were used by 59% of students whereas 87.2% students used audible ball for games.Conclusion: The results showed that majority of students used tactile based technology irrespective of visual status.Implications for rehabilitationStudents with visual disability need assistive technology for a wide range of activities including academic learning.Students in schools for the blind who have binocular best corrected vision acuity of 1/60 or better should be encouraged to use visual based assistive technology instead of tactile based.Students with binocular best corrected vision acuity less than1/60 should be encouraged to use other available tactile and sound-based assistive technologies as well as Braille books and Braille slate and stylus for their academic activities including maths and sciences.Teachers should be trained in the use of various assistive technologies for reading, writing, maths, sciences, sports, mobility and activities of daily living.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: About 490 million cases of curable Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI) occur throughout the world, of which 79 million cases occur in India annually. Sexually Transmitted Infections/Reproductive Tract Infections (STI/RTI) confers a huge economic burden on the individual and the health system. Complications of RTI/STI are many, ranging from chronic pain syndrome to infertility. Most of these complications can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. AIMS: To assess knowledge, attitude and practices on STI/RTIs among married women aged 15-45 years in rural Haryana. SETTING AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, conducted in selected villages under the primary health centre Mandi, Sonepat, Haryana. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Systematic sampling was used to cover 10 villages. In each village, every tenth house was sampled, taking first house from the center of the village. Face-to-face interview was conducted using pretested questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics and results were described in percentages. RESULTS: A total of 344 women were interviewed. About 44% women had never heard of STI/RTI. The prevalence of self-reported symptoms of STI/RTI was very high (60%). Only 40% of them opted for treatment and most common cause for not opting for treatment was that they considered it as a minor problem. Advice for use of condom during the treatment was received by only 20% of patients and only 26.5% of their husbands also received treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall knowledge, attitude and practices relating to STI/RTI among married women in rural Haryana was poor. The prevalence of self-reported STI/RTI was found to be high and treatment seeking behavior was poor.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of health anxiety among outpatients attending neurology and psychiatry outpatient setting in tertiary care hospital and understand the clinical correlates. Participants and Methods \u2003This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the outpatient settings including participants fulfilling study criteria. The assessments included semi-structured proforma for demographic and clinical details, general hypochondriasis subscale of Illness Behavior Questionnaire, and Short Health Anxiety Inventory. Data were collected in Epi-info and data analysis was done using STATA12. Results \u2003The health anxiety was reported to be 25% and 19% among psychiatry and neurology outpatients, respectively. Higher education level positively correlated with health anxiety. Skilled workers tend to have higher health anxiety than semiskilled workers. Patients with diagnosis of somatoform disorder and multiple diagnosis scored higher on health anxiety in both the settings. Conclusion \u2003Health anxiety appears to be common in psychiatry and neurology settings and needs further evaluation to understand its impact on consultation and health resource usages.",

        "title": "Is 6 months of Antitubercular Chemotherapy as Effective as More Than 6 months Regimen in Spinal Tuberculosis? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
        "abstract": "Historically, osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB), including spinal TB, was treated with prolonged course of antitubercular therapy (ATT). Due to various challenges, there has been reluctance to explore the use of short-course ATT in spinal TB. However, with the success of short-course ATT being demonstrated in other forms of extrapulmonary TB, the subject is open for debate again. Therefore, we systematically reviewed various published literature to determine whether short-course treatment regimen (6 months) of ATT provides equivalent results in terms of disease healing as long-course treatment regimen (\u22659 months) in the management of spinal TB. Five electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science) and their reference lists were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials with at least 1 year of follow-up that compared short-course with standard-course ATT for treatment of spinal TB. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed, and their data were extracted. A meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence interval (CI). The outcome measure was healed status of the disease at the final follow-up. Of 331 publications identified through literature search, eight publications describing six randomized studies were included. Moreover, 375 of 414 patients (90.58%) who received 6 months of ATT had healed status at their final follow-up compared to 404 of 463 patients (87.26%) who received \u22659 months of ATT. Overall, the healed status of spinal TB was equivalent in patients in both groups (pooled relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.04; p =0.439). However, there was considerable heterogeneity among the trials (I2=40.8%, p =0.149). The results suggest that the use of short-course (6 months) chemotherapy may be considered for the treatment of spinal TB in view of the similarity in the healing response achieved compared to treatment regimens of longer duration.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses on generic as well as vision related quality of life of cataract patients, using EQ-5D and IND-VFQ 33 instruments respectively. METHODS: An observational, longitudinal study of patients undergoing cataract surgery was carried out at three ophthalmology centres. Patients were prospectively admitted for surgery for age-related cataract. Generic quality of life was assessed by using Euroqol's EQ5D-5L questionnaire and vision related quality of life was assessed by the IND-VFQ-33 questionnaire. Data pertaining to vision function and quality of life were collected pre surgery and 4 weeks after the surgery. RESULTS: Out of total patients (n = 814) recruited for the study, 517 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for EQ5D and 519 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for IND VFQ 33 tool. The combined data from all three centres showed that Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains observed in patients undergoing phacoemulsification with foldable lens implantation (2.25 QALY) were significantly higher (0.57 QALY) as compared to Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) with PMMA lens implantation (1.68 QALY). Highest improvement however, in all three subscales of IND-VFQ-33 tool were clearly observed for SICS with PMMA lens implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The study has elicited the Health related and vision related Quality of Life scores for cataract surgeries and subsequent lens implantation. This study also offers Health State Utility Values along with visual outcomes for different surgical procedures, lenses and for the combination of surgery with lens implantation for cataract procedures providing a useful resource for future economic evaluation studies.",

Methods: The study was conducted in north India in 20,955 (97.3%) children \u226415 years who underwent visual acuity examination. Of these 20,955 children, a total of 722 children were referred with unaided visual acuity less than 6/12 in any eye. Among these referred children, parents in the age group of 5\u20139 years and children between 10 and 15 years underwent interviews using LV Prasad Functional Visual Questionnaire-20 (LVP FVQ 20) and Indian Visual Functioning Questionnaire-33 (IND VFQ-33). Following this, multiple steps were undertaken that involved expert opinion for the removal of items on basis of zero variance and factor analysis along with calculation of Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Results: A Cronbach\u2019 alpha of 0.834 was calculated for the younger age group and 0.931 for the higher age group of children. Conclusion: A new robust age-appropriate questionnaire was developed and it was observed that there was a significant change in median score (that was derived for various domains after calculating the median for the items in various domains asked pre- and post-intervention in the form of glasses or surgery) for quality of visual function in the visually impaired children. A significant change in functional vision of visually impaired children (P < 0.005) was observed in both age groups.",

All the children with visual acuity of < 6/12 in any eye in the age group between 3 and 15 years and inability to follow light in age group 0\u20133 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination. Results: A total of 13,572 (64.7%) children belonged to the age group of 6\u201315 years. Of these, a total of 507 (3.7%) were found to be having myopia (spherical equivalent of -0.50 DS or worse in one or both eyes) with positive association with higher age groups. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of myopia is 3.7%; the proportion of uncorrected myopia was 45%, which reflects that refractive error services need to be improved further.",

A large proportion of patients with undiagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes are at great risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) and irreversible blindness. The goal of DR screening is to identify people with sight-threatening DR early so that prompt treatment can be initiated, and blindness can be prevented. Systematic DR screening is essential to identify disease early, and a national effort for the same is required. We adopt a health system approach to outline the actions that need to take place for effective DR screening in the public sector in India. We discuss the role of national leadership, needs assessment, finalization of DR screening and referral pathway, trainings, strategies to improve the uptake, allocation of roles and responsibilities, public-private partnerships, quality control, and financing.",

        "title": "Evaluation of computerized health management information system for primary health care in rural India",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Comprehensive Rural Health Services Project Ballabgarh, run by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi has a computerized Health Management Information System (HMIS) since 1988. The HMIS at Ballabgarh has undergone evolution and is currently in its third version which uses generic and open source software. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized Health Management Information System in rural health system in India. METHODS: The data for evaluation were collected by in-depth interviews of the stakeholders i.e. program managers (authors) and health workers. Health Workers from AIIMS and Non-AIIMS Primary Health Centers were interviewed to compare the manual with computerized HMIS. A cost comparison between the two methods was carried out based on market costs. The resource utilization for both manual and computerized HMIS was identified based on workers' interviews. RESULTS: There have been no major hardware problems in use of computerized HMIS. More than 95% of data was found to be accurate. Health workers acknowledge the usefulness of HMIS in service delivery, data storage, generation of workplans and reports. For program managers, it provides a better tool for monitoring and supervision and data management. The initial cost incurred in computerization of two Primary Health Centers was estimated to be Indian National Rupee (INR) 1674,217 (USD 35,622). Equivalent annual incremental cost of capital items was estimated as INR 198,017 (USD 4213). The annual savings is around INR 894,283 (USD 11,924). CONCLUSION: The major advantage of computerization has been in saving of time of health workers in record keeping and report generation. The initial capital costs of computerization can be recovered within two years of implementation if the system is fully operational. Computerization has enabled implementation of a good system for service delivery, monitoring and supervision.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: India is in the midst of an epidemiological transition with non-communicable diseases increasing in importance. Targeting the risk factors for non-communicable diseases is recognized as an essential preventive strategy. There is lack of good quality data on prevalence of risk factors. The present study addresses this challenge in urban population of Ballabgarh town in Faridabad district of Haryana. METHODS: A total of 1263 male and 1326 female respondents were selected using multistage systematic random sampling, in 5 age groups of 10 years (15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64). The World Health Organization's STEPS approach entails stepwise collection of the risk factor data based on standardized questionnaires (step 1), basic physical measures in step 2 and finally in 3rd step, basic biochemical investigations such as blood sugar and cholesterol. The prevalence was adjusted to the age and sex strata of urban Faridabad as per census 2001. RESULTS: The prevalence of current daily use of smoked tobacco was 22.2% (95% CI7colon; 20.0-24.6) for males and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.9-2.2) for females. In males the prevalence of current alcohol consumption was 28.9% (95% CI: 26.4-31.5). Physical inactivity was reported by 23.2% (95% CI: 20.9-25.6) of males and 52.4% (95% CI: 49.7-55.1) of female respondents. Only 8.6% of males and 4.4% of females were consuming adequate portions of the fruits and vegetables. 23.1% (95% CI: 20.8-25.5) males and 15.7% (95% CI: 13.87ndash;17.8) females were either in Stage 1 and 2 hypertension (JNC VII) or were taking anti-hypertensives. Among males, 25.4% (95% CI: 23.0-27.9) and, among females 34.9% (95% CI: 32.3-37.6) were overweight. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use among males and physical inactivity among females was high. Low consumption of fruits and vegetables, hypertension and overweight was equally common among both the sexes in the population studied. Thus there is an urgent need for initiating measures at the risk factor level to counter this modern day epidemic of non-communicable disorders, within this urban community.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) contribute to ocular morbidity and are emerging as diseases with significant public health impact. Our aim was to assess the countrywide prevalence of DR and sight-threatening DR (STDR) among persons with diabetes and to evaluate the coverage of DR examinations among them. Methods: The present survey was planned to estimate the burden of DR in the population aged \u226550 years for assisting in the planning and prioritization of diabetic eye services. For this survey, 21 districts with a high prevalence of DM were selected among the 31 districts where the national blindness and visual impairment survey was conducted. The total sample size was 63,000 people aged 50 years and above. DR was assessed by dilated fundus examination with indirect ophthalmoscope and was graded according to Scottish DR grading. STDR included severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, and clinically significant macular edema. Results: The prevalence of diabetes in the surveyed population was 11.8%. Among them, one-third were newly diagnosed DM, that is, diagnosed at the time of the survey. The study revealed that the prevalence of DR among persons with diabetes was 16.9%, the prevalence of STDR was 3.6%, and the prevalence of mild retinopathy was 11.8%. Risk factors for DR in the current study were duration of diabetes (>10 years, OR 4.8, 95% CI: 3.3\u20136.9), poor glycemic control (\u2265200 mg/dL, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2\u20131.7) and insulin treatment (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7\u20134.1). Conclusion: The current study highlights the substantial burden of DM and DR in India and the critical need to adopt a coordinated and multisectoral approach to reduce their prevalence. There is a need for early identification of persons with diabetes and their routine screening for DR along with availability of treatment facilities.",

        "abstract": "Background: World report on vision makes integrated people-centered eye care as care model of choice. Integrating eye care with the existing public health system makes services available, accessible, affordable, and sustainable. Being from the community, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are better suited to improve people's eye health-seeking behavior. Objectives: This study aims to assess the eye care-seeking behavior of community and to understand their response toward the approach of integrated vision centers (VC) with ASHA involvement. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in South Delhi district where integrated VC were functional for more than a year. These centers were supervised by medical officer in-charge, under whom ophthalmic assistants, ASHAs, auxiliary nurse midwives, and pharmacist work. ASHAs were trained in community-based primary eye care. The community survey was conducted on eye health-seeking behavior and utilization of VC services. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Results: Out of 1571 study participants, 998 reported any ophthalmic illness in family in the past 6 months as against 1302 who reported nonophthalmic illness in family. The majority (1461, 90%) were aware about integrated VC and half of them (748, 51.2%) visited it. Of them, 64.2% were motivated through ASHAs. ASHAs spread awareness about eye diseases, eye treatment facility, and referred patients from the community. The majority (93%) were happy with the integrated VC and 87.8% were happy with ASHAs. Conclusion: Integrated VC with ASHA engagement could pave the way for universal eye health. Understanding people's needs and engaging community would increase the demand for eye care.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Community volunteers like Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) could be utilized for linking community and eye care services. Research is needed to effectively utilize them. This study was to assess whether ASHAs could imbibe new knowledge in eye care and conduct vision screening. METHODS: Settings and Design: A pre-post-intervention study in South Delhi Integrated Vision Centres. It was conducted from January 2016 to March 2017. One day of conceptual training followed by hands-on training in vision screening was imparted to ASHAs. The knowledge was assessed thrice: before, immediately after, and following 1 year after training. The vision screening skill was assessed twice. Descriptive analysis using percentages, mean and standard deviations. Paired t-test was used for assessing the change in scores. RESULTS: A total of 102 ASHAs were recruited. A significant increase in the knowledge score of ASHAs before (14.96) and after training (25.38) (P < 0.001) was noted. The knowledge score was sustained at 1 year (21.75). The satisfactory skill of vision screening was seen in 88 (86.3%) ASHAs after training, while 79 (77.5%) ASHAs still retained it after 1 year. CONCLUSION: The potential to involve ASHAs in community-based frontline eye care activities: awareness generation of eye diseases, identification of referrable conditions, and facilitating individuals to seek eye care facilities. This study informs about the duration, frequency, and content of the training. It also provides evidence on the improvement and sustainability of eye care knowledge and skills by ASHAs after conceptual and hands-on training.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the burden, clinical features and associations of trichiasis due to trachomatous and non-trachomatous aetiologies. METHODS: Consenting patients presenting with trichiasis of either eyelid (of one or both eyes) attending the outpatient department, cornea and oculoplasty clinics of a tertiary eye care hospital in New Delhi between August 2018 to March 2020 were included. A comprehensive examination including visual acuity and anterior segment evaluation and photography was performed. Grade of trichiasis, laterality, presence and grade of entropion, and information on corneal opacity, conjunctival scarring, Herbert's pits, and pannus, if present, were recorded in the case record form. RESULTS: Overall, 302 patients (454 eyes) with trichiasis were recruited. The most common attributed cause of upper eyelid trichiasis (276 patients, 405 eyes) was trachoma (26% of patients), followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome (23%), blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (17%) and old age (10%). A total of 296/405 eyes (73%) had some form of corneal involvement. Trachoma was not identified as the cause of trichiasis in any eye with lower eyelid-only disease. CONCLUSION: Only about a quarter of upper eyelid trichiasis in this peri-elimination setting was attributed to trachoma. A distinction between trachomatous and non-trachomatous trichiasis is imperative to meaningfully determine whether elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has occurred. These data may have implications for population-based estimates of TT prevalence in India and other peri-elimination settings.",

        "title": "Predictors of Operative Duration in Posterior Spinal Fusion for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Background Accurate prediction of operative duration is necessary for efficient operating room scheduling, minimizing cancellations, shortening waitlists, better risk stratification, and effective preoperative counseling. Prolonged operative duration is also associated with negative patient outcomes. Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is typically a lengthy surgical procedure with variable operative duration. The purpose of this study is to identify patient-, procedure-, and surgeon-specific variables that influence the operative duration in PSF for AIS and determine its impact on early postoperative outcomes. Methods Hospital records of 150 AIS patients who underwent PSF at a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Various patient-, procedure-, and surgeon-specific variables\u2014deemed to be possibly affecting the operative duration\u2014were analyzed. A multivariate regression model was used to identify independent predictors of operative duration. The association between operative duration and early postoperative outcome measures was determined. Results The final model obtained from the multivariate regression analysis included the following factors: experience of the chief surgeon (\u03b2 = \u22120.36), Cobb angle of the major structural curve (\u03b2 = 0.35), number of screws inserted (\u03b2 = 0.28), coronal deformity angular ratio (\u03b2 = 0.20), and apical vertebral rotation (\u03b2 = \u22120.21 to 0.03). The model could explain 44% of the variability in the operative duration (R 2 = 0.44). The operative duration had a significant correlation with estimated blood loss, need for perioperative blood transfusion, and length of hospital stay. Conclusions A set of variables that predict the variability in operative duration during PSF for AIS was identified, with the experience of the chief surgeon and the severity of the curve being the strongest predictors. Clinical Relevance The results of this study emphasize the need for each hospital and surgical team to identify predictors of operative duration in their setup in order to better anticipate prolonged operative duration.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors for pterygium in geographically diverse regions of India. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional multicentric study was conducted in adults aged \u226540 years in plains, hilly and coastal regions of India. All participants underwent a detailed questionnaire-based assessment for sun exposure, usage of sun protective measures, exposure to indoor smoke, and smoking. Detailed ocular and systemic examinations were performed. Pterygium was diagnosed and graded clinically by slit-lamp examination. Association of pterygium with sociodemographic, ophthalmological, and systemic parameters was assessed. Physical environmental parameters for the study period were estimated. RESULTS: Of the 12,021 eligible subjects, 9735 (81% response rate) participated in the study. The prevalence of pterygium in any eye was 13.2% (95% CI: 12.5%-13.9%), and bilateral pterygium was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2-7.2). The prevalence increased with age (<0.001) irrespective of sex and was highest in those aged 60-69 years (15.8%). The prevalence was highest in coastal (20.3%), followed by plains (11.2%) and hilly regions (9.1%). On multi-logistic regression, pterygium was positively associated with coastal location (P<0.001), illiteracy (P = 0.037), increasing lifetime sun exposure (P<0.001), and negatively associated with BMI \u226525 kg/m2 (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Pterygium prevalence is high in the rural Indian population. The association of pterygium with several potentially modifiable risk factors reflects its multifactorial etiology and provides targets for preventive measures.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Avoidable blindness is a significant public health problem in India. Nationally representative RAAB surveys (Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness) are being conducted periodically in the country to know the current status of blindness in the country. The current study describes the findings from the RAAB survey conducted during 2015-19 in India. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional, population-based survey was conducted across the entire country among persons aged 50 years and above using RAAB version 6 methodology. Presenting and pinhole visual acuity was recorded followed by lens examination using a torchlight. In order to estimate the prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in overall population in India, district weights were assigned to each of the 31 surveyed districts and the prevalence was standardized using the RAAB software. RESULTS: The overall weighted, age-gender standardized, prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in better eye) in population aged \u226550 years was 1.99% (95% CI 1.94%, 2.13%) and of visual impairment (VI) (presenting visual acuity <6/12 in better eye) was 26.68% (95% CI 26.57-27.17%). On multivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratio showed that blindness was associated with age \u2265 80 years (OR = 20.3, 95% CI: 15.6-26.4) and being illiterate (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 3.6-8.9). Blindness was not found to be significantly associated with either gender or locality. CONCLUSION: The results of the survey demonstrate that currently more than one fourth of persons aged 50 years and above are visually impaired (PVA<6/12 in better eye) in India. The prevalence of blindness among them is 1.99%, and older age and illiteracy are significantly associated with blindness. Major causes of blindness included cataract (66.2%), corneal opacity (CO) (8.2%), cataract surgical complications (7.2%), posterior segment disorders (5.9%) and glaucoma (5.5%). The proportion of blindness and visual impairment that is due to avoidable causes include 92.9% and 97.4% respectively.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Assistive technology (AT) has recently received considerable attention around the world. Studies have shown poor access to assistive technology for visual impairment (ATVI) in schools for the blind in India. The present article aimed at designing a school-based model to improve AT access in schools and provide hands-on training, and identify types of ocular morbidities present among students. METHODS: The vision rehabilitation (VR) team of a tertiary eye-care center visited schools for the blind as a part of community-based VR services. The team conducted a basic eye examination and assessed best-corrected vision acuity (BCVA) and provided VR services. Furthermore, two schools were selected to establish an ATVI learning center as a pilot model. RESULTS: In total, 1887 students were registered for VR and obtained their disability certificates in 2019-20. Retina problems (25.7%), globe abnormalities (25.5%), optic nerve atrophy (13.6%), and squint (12.0%) were common ocular problems identified in students. Around 50.3% of students had BCVA3 1/60 in the better eye who would be benefited from visual-based AT, and the remaining students with visual substitution AT. Further, 20.8% of them who had near vision between N18 to N24 would be benefitted from large print books. Two schools were provided ATVI with support from the WHO. Familiarization, demonstration, and initial training for ATVI were carried out. CONCLUSION: A sizable number of the students would be benefitted from visual-based AT apart from visual substitutions AT. Students were interested to have such ATVI centers in the school for academic and non-academic skills development.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To measure the prevalence and causes of visual impairment (VI) among the 40+ age population in two coastal districts of India and to determine the levels of effective cataract surgical coverage (eCSC) and effective refractive error coverage (eREC) in the study population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done on 4200 people chosen using cluster sampling in two coastal districts of Odisha, an eastern state in India. A team consisting of trained optometrists and social workers conducted the ocular examination which included unaided, pinhole, and aided visual acuity assessments followed by examination of the anterior segment and lens. RESULTS: Overall, 3745 (89.2%) participants were examined from 60 study clusters, 30 in each district. Among those examined, 1677 (44.8%) were men, 2554 (68.2%) were educated and number? (17.8%) used distance spectacles during the survey. The prevalence of VI adjusted for age and gender was 12.77% (95% CI 11.85-13.69%). Multiple logistic regression showed that older age (OR 3.1; 95% CI 2.0-4.7) and urban residence (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with VI. Being educated (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.3-0.6) and using glasses (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.5-0.2) were found to provide protection; therefore, resulting in lower instances of VI. Cataract (62.7%) and uncorrected refractive errors (27.1%) were the two main causes of VI. The eCSC was 35.1%, the eREC for distance was 40.0%, and the eREC for near was 35.7%. CONCLUSION: VI remains a challenge in Odisha, as the prevalence is high and the surgical coverage is poor. Nearly 90% of VI is avoidable indicating that targeted interventions are required to address this problem.",

        "abstract": "Background: Family physicians (FPs) encounter numerous patients who need eye care services. For providing eye care services at the primary level, they need to be abreast with the common disorders, their management and appropriate referral. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the socio-demographic and ocular morbidity profile of the beneficiaries, seasonal pattern of few ocular disorders and to find the proportion of blindness that is avoidable at the primary level. Methodology: Study was conducted in 25 vision centers across Delhi. Chart review was done in each center and retrospective data of previous 4 years was analyzed. Socio-demographic, ocular morbidity profile and trend of selected diseases was deducted and causes of blindness were determined. Results: Around 62.76% of patients were women and 78.26% were new patients. A seasonal peak of conjunctivitis was observed during the spring season. The common conditions detected by optometrists were refractive errors (34.68%), presbyopia (14.15%), cataract (14.02%), conjunctivitis (9.84%) and diseases of ocular adnexa (1.35%). In the age group \u226550 years, the proportion of patients who were blind was 2.5%, 39.0% had VI. The proportion of VI patients in all the categories was higher in women as compared to men. In patients ages \u226550 years, 81.4% of the blindness was avoidable. Conclusions: Women outnumbered men in availing services at the center and the proportion of visual impairment was also higher in them. The major causes of blindness in the older population were cataract and corneal-opacity, and it is avoidable by strengthening primary eye care services by FPs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The background of this study is to determine the awareness about health seeking behaviour (HSB) in parents of visually impaired children in a population-based study. METHODS: The study was conducted in population <16 years in urban area of North India. A total of 20,955 (97.3%) children underwent visual acuity examination. Of these, 789 children were referred to the centrally based clinic with unaided visual acuity <6/12 in any eye for undergoing detailed ophthalmic examination. RESULTS: Along with ocular examination, the parents of these 789 referred children, were interviewed for the questions related to HSB, the most common ocular symptom known to them was redness of eyes followed by watering and diminution of vision, 249 (34.6%) denied for any ocular problem in their children previously, amongst the remaining 469 parents/care takers with any ocular problem, a total of 367 (51.1%) referred children wore glasses and the proportion of parents wearing glasses was similar amongst these children (11.7% fathers and 11% mothers). Amongst the 118 respondents of visually impaired children (presenting visual acuity less than 6/18 in better eye with available correction), 56 (47.5%) denied for any ocular problem in their children previously, of the remaining 62 (52.5%), parents, 58 (93.5%) had consulted various healthcare agencies, 45.8% of the respondents reported not said that their children wore glasses prescribed to them. Only 24 (20.3%) respondents were aware that Vitamin A is good for eye health. DISCUSSION: Diminution of vision, watering and redness of eyes were the most common ocular symptoms known to parents of referred children. HSB can be further improved via primary healthcare physicians by primary healthcare creating awareness about importance of wearing glasses and healthy diet in parents of visually impaired children.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: In the mid-twentieth century, trachoma was endemic in the northwestern states of India. We aimed to generate recent estimates of prevalence of trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) and trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in ten suspected-endemic districts across seven previously hyper-endemic states and union territories for trachoma in India including Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. METHODS: Population-based prevalence surveys were undertaken in 10 districts. In each of those districts, two-stage cluster sampling was used to select a sample of 2000 children aged 1-9 years and all adults aged \u226515 years in the enumerated households from a total of 20 clusters per district. Consenting eligible participants were examined for trachoma by trained ophthalmologists using the World Health Organization's simplified grading system. Data were analyzed at the district level. RESULTS: A total of 13,802 households were surveyed in which 19,662 children were examined for TF and 44,135 adults aged \u226515 years were examined for TT. District-level TF prevalence in 1-9-year-olds ranged from 0.1% in Bikaner (95% CI: 0.01-0.3) to 2.1% in Dholpur (95% CI: 1.6-2.8) and that of trichiasis ranged from 0.7 per 1000 in Pauri Garhwal (95% CI: 0.01-1.4) to 22.1 per 1000 (95% CI: 15.8-28.4) in Car Nicobar. In four districts (Car Nicobar, Dholpur, Hoshiarpur, Tonk), trichiasis prevalence in adults aged \u226515 years was \u22650.2%. CONCLUSION: TF was not a public health problem in any of the districts surveyed; thus, antibiotic mass drug administration is not needed. However, TT among adults was found to be above 0.2% in four districts; thus, further trichiasis surgery interventions at the public health level are warranted to achieve elimination. These findings will facilitate planning for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem in India.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the burden of trachoma and its related risk factors among the underserved population of sixteen states/union territories (UTs) in India. METHODS: Trachoma rapid assessment (TRA) was conducted in seventeen Enumeration Units (EUs) spanning sixteen states/UTs in India according to standard WHO guidelines. A total of ten clusters were selected in each EU and 50 children aged 1-9\u2009years were assessed clinically for signs of active trachoma and facial cleanliness in each cluster. Additionally, all adults aged 15\u2009years and above in the same households were examined for evidence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity. Environmental risk factors contributing to trachoma were also noted in all households. RESULTS: Out of 766 districts in India, seventeen EUs were selected for TRA depending on evidence of socio-developmental indicators like poverty and suboptimal access to water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. The total population of the selected clusters was 21,774 in the 17 EUs. Overall, 104 of 8807 children (1.2%; CI: 0.9-1.4) had evidence of follicular or inflammatory stages of trachoma. Nearly 16.6% (CI:15.8-17.4) children were noted to have unclean faces in the 170 clusters. Trichiasis was noted in 19 adults (2.1 per 1000; CI:1.2-3.2 per 1000). Environmental sanitation was found to be unsatisfactory in two-thirds (67.8%) of the surveyed households in the clusters mainly due to improper garbage disposal. CONCLUSION: Active trachoma was not a public health problem in any of the EUs surveyed. However, burden of TT among adults was found to be above 0.2% in two EUs; hence, further public health interventions like trichiasis surgery were recommended.",

        "abstract": "Background: Young age in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) demands bone-preserving, short-stem arthroplasty. Several designs including neck-preserving stems and neck-resecting, shortened, standard stems are classified as short stems. There is a paucity of literature investigating risk factors and outcomes of intraoperative complications of neck preserving, short-stem arthroplasty in ONFH. Methods: A total of 107 hips operated with METHA short-stem arthroplasty for ONFH were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age of patients was 43.7 years (range, 27-60 years). Nine patients had an intraoperative fracture. Seven hips received prophylactic cerclage wiring for poor bone quality. Patients were invited for clinical and radiological evaluation at the latest follow-up. Results: The mean follow-up of patients was 47.2 months. Significant association with intraoperative fractures and the need for prophylactic cerclage wiring were found in steroids-, alcohol-, and chronic renal failure-induced ONFH. However, patient sex, body mass index, traumatic/idiopathic ONFH, previous implant in situ, prosthesis size, and single-sitting bilateral total hip replacement (THA) were not the risk factors. All hips showed signs of osteointegration at final follow-up. No revision was done during the study period for any cause. Conclusions: METHA short-stem THA offers excellent functional and radiological outcomes in ONFH. However, precaution must be exercised in patients with steroids-, alcohol-, and renal disorders-induced ONFN due to poor bone quality and higher chances of intraoperative fractures. Also, additional measures such as the use of a high-speed burr and prophylactic cerclage wiring in ONFH may allow predictable and safe use of short stems.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To develop and implement a community-based programme for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in urban populations of Delhi. Methods Known diabetics (KDs) aged 40 years and older were identified through house-to-house surveys, volunteers and publicity. All KDs were referred to DR screening camps organised locally where procedures included brief medical history, ocular examination and non-mydriatic fundus photography using portable handheld camera. Fundal images were graded on the spot by trained optometrists for DR. Patients with DR were referred to tertiary centre for management. Results A total of 11 566 KDs were identified, of whom 9435 (81.6%) visited DR screening camps and 8432 (89.4%) had DR gradable images. DR was identified in 13.5% of subjects; 351 cases were mild NPDR, 567 moderate, 92 severe. Seventy-seven had PDR, and 49 had DME, and 2.7% of participants were blind (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in better eye). Non-use of lifestyle management, presence of systemic complications, BMI <18.5 kg/m2, disease duration of >5 years and uncontrolled diabetes were associated with increased odds of DR. All cases with DR were referred, and 420 (37%) successful referrals to base hospital were observed. Conclusion The programme of creating awareness about DR, identifying KDs and optometrist-led DR screening using non-mydriatic fundus camera based in slums was successful.",

        "abstract": "PRCIS: This study evaluated the allostatic load (AL) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and reported that the AL score was significantly higher in glaucoma patients compared with age-matched controls. PURPOSE: To evaluate the AL in patients with POAG. METHODS: This case-control study comprised 50 POAG (glaucoma patients) and 50 age-matched controls without glaucoma (controls). AL was estimated based on 13 variables: systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, homocysteine, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, body mass index, serum cortisol, glycosylated hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine clearance, and C-reactive protein. High-risk thresholds were determined based on biological cutoffs of each biomarker. One point was assigned for each biomarker reading above cutoff and were summated to obtain AL score; score \u22654 was considered high. RESULTS: Mean age of glaucoma patients was 60.82\u00b16.26 and 60.14\u00b16.72 years in controls ( P =0.602). All components of AL score (except C-reactive protein) had higher values in glaucoma patients. There was a statistically significant difference in homocysteine ( P =0.001), total cholesterol ( P =0.037), high-density lipoprotein ( P =0.005), and glycosylated hemoglobin ( P =0.003). Mean AL score was 4.68\u00b12.09 in glaucoma patients and 3.32\u00b11.34 in controls ( P <0.001). There was significant association of high AL score with older age ( P =0.006), low socioeconomic status ( P =0.020), and glaucoma severity ( P =0.001). Negative correlation was seen between AL and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (Right Eye: r =-0.37, P <0.001; Left Eye: r =-0.298, P <0.001) and visual field mean deviation (Right Eye: r =-0.469, P <0.001; Left Eye: r =-0.520, P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma patients exhibited allostatic overload indicating physiological dysregulation to chronic stress although additional research is required to establish causality. A holistic approach with lifestyle modifications to reduce chronic stress should be an integral part of managing glaucoma patients as it would serve both to possibly reduce or prevent disease progression and improve overall health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The present study was a population-based study to determine the prevalence and causes of low vision in children less than 16 years in North India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 40 clusters of urban Delhi. Children aged less than 16 years underwent visual acuity screening using age-appropriate visual acuity charts. All children with visual acuity of <6/12 in any eye in the age group between 3 and 15 years and inability to follow the light in age less than 3 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination in a centrally based clinic. Cycloplegic examination and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed. They were examined by an ophthalmologist to determine the prevalence and causes of functional low vision (FLV). The prevalence of FLV was compared with other population-based studies across India and other parts of the world. Results: Amongst 20,955 children examined for visual acuity, 789 children were referred to the central clinic for detailed ophthalmic examination. The overall prevalence of low vision was 0.62 per 1,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12\u20131.90). The main anatomical cause of low vision was retinal abnormalities. Conclusion: Although the prevalence of children with low vision decreased as compared to previous population-based studies. There is an important need to create awareness among parents on appropriate and timely usage of low-vision devices (LVDs) at an affordable cost to improve the visual quality in children with low vision.",

        "abstract": "Background: Effective Cataract Surgical Coverage (eCSC) is a core outcomes domain indicator to assess accessibility and quality of eye care services with limited available information. Purpose: To generate baseline estimates of eCSC for India. Methods: We performed the analysis of data pooled from Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness surveys conducted in 31 districts of India during 2015-2019 among persons aged 50+ years. eCSC was calculated at various thresholds, the primary being operable cataract at best corrected visual acuity <6/12, good outcome at presenting visual acuity of 6/12. Results: Age-sex standardized and weighed eCSC in India was 36.7% (95% CI: 33.6, 39.9), and cataract surgical coverage (CSC) was 57.3% (95% CI: 53.3, 61.2), a relative quality gap in cataract surgery being 36.0%. eCSC in males was higher at 38.0% than females (35.6%). eCSC increased with education from 31.0% in illiterate participants to 59.7% in class 10 educated. On multivariate analysis, rural setting, increasing age, and residence in eastern or northeastern zones of India continued to be associated with poor/worse eCSC, while female gender was associated with higher eCSC. District-wide variations in eCSC were observed. Conclusion: Developmental factors have an important bearing on eCSC in India. Geographical variations point toward the need for targeted, locally relevant strategies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Different statistical approaches for estimating excess deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have led to varying estimates. In this study, we developed and validated a covariate-based model (CBM) with imputation for prediction of district-level excess deaths in India. METHODS: We used data extracted from deaths registered under the Civil Registration System for 2015-19 for 684 of 713 districts in India to estimate expected deaths for 2020 through a negative binomial regression model (NBRM) and to calculate excess observed deaths. Specifically, we used 15 covariates across four domains (state, health system, population, COVID-19) in a zero inflated NBRM to identify covariates significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) associated with excess deaths estimate in 460 districts. We then validated this CBM in 140 districts by comparing predicted and estimated excess. For 84 districts with missing covariates, we validated the imputation with CBM by comparing estimated with predicted excess deaths. We imputed covariate data to predict excess deaths for 29 districts which did not have data on deaths. RESULTS: The share of elderly and urban population, the under-five mortality rate, prevalence of diabetes, and bed availability were significantly associated with estimated excess deaths and were used for CBM. The mean of the CBM-predicted excess deaths per district (x\u0304\u2009=\u2009989, standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u20091588) was not significantly different from the estimated one (x\u0304\u2009=\u20091448, SD\u2009=\u20093062) (P\u2009=\u20090.25). The estimated excess deaths (n\u2009=\u200967\u2009540; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u200935\u2009431, 99\u2009648) were similar to the predicted excess death (n\u2009=\u200964\u2009570; 95% CI\u2009=\u200954\u2009140, 75\u2009000) by CBM with imputation. The total national estimate of excess deaths for all 713 districts was 794\u2009989 (95% CI\u2009=\u2009664\u2009895, 925\u2009082).

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: As per the recent World Health Organization estimates, approximately 2.2 billion people have near and distance vision impairment (VI) globally, and out of this almost 50% is avoidable. METHODS: The Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Visual Impairment survey was a cross-sectional study conducted in September 2021, using cluster random sampling in 42 clusters with a cluster size of 140, giving a total of 6000 participants. Two teams comprising of trained optometrists and social workers conducted the ocular examination which included unaided, pinhole, and aided visual acuity assessments followed by examination of the anterior segment and lens. Distance visual acuity was measured using simplified tumbling \"E\" charts of different sizes for VA of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. The lens assessment was done in an un-dilated pupil with torch light by the optometrist. RESULTS: Overall, 6520 individuals aged 6 years and above were enumerated, of whom 5440 (83.4%) were examined. The response rate for examination was better among females (93.1%) than males (73.9%), and it decreased from 93.8% in the age group 6-15 years to 77.1% in the 45+ age group. The prevalence of blindness and VI were 0.18% (95% CI: 0.06-0.29) and 4.19% (95%CI: 3.65-4.72), respectively. The major causes of VI in all age groups were uncorrected refractive error (65.4%), cataract (23.7%), cataract surgical complications (2.6%), corneal opacity (0.4%), and other posterior segment diseases (7.5%). The effective cataract surgical coverage (eCSC) was 61.8%, effective refractive error coverage (eREC) for distance vision was 59.8%, and eREC for near vision was 47.0%. CONCLUSION: The RAAVI methodology is suitable to measure effective coverage in the general population, both for baseline measurement and periodic monitoring. The 2030 targets for the surveyed district are 90% eCSC and 100% eREC. Such exercises need to be conducted in each district of the country to determine the baseline and target values of effective coverage.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conducting a study in rural pre-dominant areas will help to understand the penetration of the vaccination campaign during the COVID-19 health crisis. This study aimed to investigate vaccination coverage against COVID-19 among the rural adult population in India and to identify factors associated with vaccination coverage. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the rural population in one district of north India from January to February 2023. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed on the SurveyMonkey digital platform for interviewing the participants, which consisted of questions related to socio-demographic profile, health problems, vaccination status, types of vaccine, re-infection after vaccination, and functional difficulties. The data regarding infection with COVID-19 was collected based on self-reported positive testing for SARS-CoV 2 on RT-PCR. FINDINGS: A total of 3700 eligible individuals were enumerated for the survey, out of which 2954 (79.8%) were interviewed. The infection rate of past COVID-19 infection, based on self-report of testing positive, was 6.2% (95%CI: 5.3-7.1). Covishield vaccine was received by most participants (81.3%, 2380) followed by Covaxin (12.3%, 361) and Pfizer manufactured vaccine (0.03,1). The coverage for first, second, and booster doses of the vaccine was 98.2% (2902), 94.8% (2802), and 10.7% (315) respectively. The risk of reinfection at 12 months or more among participants with two doses of vaccine was 1.6% (46/2802, 95%CI: 1.2-2.1). The coverage among those with severe functional difficulties was lesser as compared to those with some or no difficulties. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination coverage against COVID-19 in rural Haryana, India is not dependent on factors like gender or occupation but is dependent on age and education. Although the full and partial vaccination coverage is high, the booster dose coverage is poor. In addition, the presence of severe disability was significantly associated with reduced vaccination coverage.",
